      "sati": "literally means “memory” or “recollection”, from _√sar_ (“remember”), whereas “mindfulness” often has connotations of “focused awareness” that are foreign to the term _sati_. [MN 53](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53) defines a noble disciple endowed with supreme _sati_ as “one who remembers what was said and done long ago”. <br><br>It is the same quality, just applied to one’s present experience, that is used in all the _satipaṭṭhānas_."
