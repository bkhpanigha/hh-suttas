      "sati": "literally, “memory” or “recollection”, from _√sar_ (“remember”).“Mindfulness”, owing to the prevalence of mainstream misinterpretations, often carries connotations of “focused awareness” that are foreign to the term _sati_. [MN 53](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53) defines a noble disciple endowed with supreme _sati_ as “one who remembers what was said and done long ago”, and even in everyday life, it’s evident that remembering is *not* a matter of unbroken attention; otherwise, we would forget everything we don't focus on continuously, and we wouldn’t be able to keep an overarching goal in mind while switching between various subtasks. <br><br>It is this same quality of remembering, just applied aspects of one’s present experience that are relevant to freedom from suffering, that underlies each of the four _satipaṭṭhānas_.",
      "saṅkhāra": "lit. “(a) doing”. The traditional “(volitional) formations”, “fabrications”, etc., are mystical/abstruse, while “intentions” is an oversimplification, and corresponds actually to _cetanā_, a specific type of _saṅkhāra_. <br><br>Regarding _saṅkhārā_ as fundamentally volitional is misleading, since the reason for their presence is not mere will, but ignorance (“With ignorance as basis, activities [exist]...”). Conversely, their cessation isn't reached by intentionally refraining from choice, but by fully dispelling ignorance (“With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, activities cease...”)."
