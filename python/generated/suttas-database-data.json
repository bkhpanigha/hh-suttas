There is a stark difference between this and the general expectation of what the goal of the practice is. What’s being described here is that the right dispassion is not concerned with altering one’s subjective experience of an object—which requires time, while the Dhamma is timeless (_akālika_)—, but with detachment [_towards the subjective experience_](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=thag1.21). This is much more profound and hard to see and develop, while on the other hand there’s an endless array of mundane methods, such as psychotherapy, to modify one’s subjective experience of things and thereby *decrease*, not *uproot*, suffering.

Sofiguratively, it means being ‘fixed’: sometimes ‘obstinate’like in [MN 16](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn16), or in a more subtle sense one could say ‘having astake in something.’  ‘Barrenness’ doesn’t fit for most contexts, see especially Snp. 1.12 where the sage is described as‘having cut down what has grown, not replanting’ (i.e. barrenness is actually what makes him a sage!) and later in the sameverse as _akhilaṁ._ ” ",

      "snp4.4:1.4": "These lines neither confirm nor deny the validity of what he regards as “the highest purity”. The point is that the very attitude of taking *something* as pure and giving it priority over everything else implies conceiving (even in relation to Nibbāna, as per [MN 1](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1)), and it is this very conceiving that is the root of the problem. This does not mean one should instead try to deny or dismiss everything that can be known or experienced, (which would imply ‘resting on’ that very act of denial). And resting on things in this way is not a deliberate act: it takes place simply by overlooking one’s attitude and prioritizing the content and ideas regarding the relevant experience. The question of whether the experience itself is “right” or not rests on a wrong premise. ",
      "snp4.4:2.3": "This line, in the context of the preceding ones, encapsulates the entirety of what is *not* Dhamma, (in this way negatively summing up the entire Dhamma as well): nothing but the abandonment of all attachment ([regardless of attachment to *what*](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1#mn1:26.1-mn1:26.4)) gives rise to wisdom, (i.e. full understanding of the nature of any and all things, as the verse further down says) and abandons suffering at its root.<br><br> That is another reason why knowledge and vision in and of themselves, in the sense of any experience no matter how lofty, can never be the source of purity – it is precisely by expecting purity and peace to come from ‘something else’ in this way that one overlooks that very attitude of *reliance* on that something, which is the immediate cause of impurity.

The notion that enlightenment is something that “occurs”, an extraordinary experience that manifests as a result of meditation, is quite common. Although the particulars of it may vary, its general nature is common to every distorted interpretation of the Dhamma. ",
      "snp4.4:5.2": "<em>Anīgha:</em> Again, it is not the presence of notions that is the issue, but implicitly believing purity to lie somewhere within the sphere of notions, whether high or low. The Right View could be said to be [the understanding of the whole domain of notions and ideas](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn8#mn8:3.4-mn8:3.6), rather than just one of the many possibilities within said domain.

",
      "snp4.4:7.2": "<em>Anīgha:</em> Which would imply that purity is *in* that concrete phenomenon or experience they’re referring to, but as explained in the first comment above, even Nibbāna is not “pure” when accompanied by conceiving. Thus, it is the principle of non-conceiving and dispassion in regard to anything anyone might call “the utmost purity” that is the actual purity/Nibbāna. <br><br> In other words, true safety lies in not finding safety in anything whatsoever.

      "sn1.1:0.3": "The following describes the Middle Way, which lies not in “moderation”, but in transcending both possible extremes in one’s attitude of relating to phenomena: nurturing delight in them on the one hand, and trying to abolish them or replace them on the other. Both attitudes involve a mistaken sense of ownership, and the right effort the Buddha taught is the cultivation of “neither standing nor striving”, as explained in [MN 134](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134). In other words, the right “effortlessness” that does not drift into negligence requires diligence (and the foundation of unwavering virtue remains unchanged from beginning to end). It does not come naturally or intuitively, since it goes completely against the grain of the untrained mind."

    "comment": {
      "sn1.20:21.5": "Notice that these lines do not affirm a hidden reality that lies beyond the domain of the describable. What’s being expressed is that suffering arises due to the mistaken [_conceiving_ of an entity existing outside](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1) the describable (i.e., the experience as a whole) and who wields mastery over it. But if instead of outright denying that there is a sense of self and leaning onto the empty theoretical statement that “the self is an illusion” or similar, one comes to fully understand—within that same present experience—that the sense of self that factually manifests _also_ falls squarely within the domain of the describable, it will cease to be misconceived as an outside master. And therefore it cannot rightly be called a self anymore—while the domain of the describable (the five aggregates) continues to be all that there is. In this way one ceases to be “established in the describable” without going somewhere else (which would only lead to becoming equally established in another describable phenomenon: a transcendent reality that supposedly lies “beyond all experience” is describable to that extent, is being experienced, and thus lies within the five aggregates). ",
      "sn1.20:23.3": "These three judgments cannot be totally eliminated, for even if such an attempt succeeded, there would always be the implication that not having them is “better” and having them is “worse”. But by seeing them as phenomena, enduring within the experience but on a subtler level, one ceases to take them for granted, and there will no longer be the implicit discrepancy/conflict felt when there is a sense of “lack”, nor any actions that come out of that. If one sees, as a phenomenon in its own right, the suggestion of this or that experience as “better” and the associated sense of “lack“—even if it is an accurate idea of Nibbāna—then one can get to see how Nibbāna actually lies in the subduing of delight towards any and all phenomena as such, [*including that one*](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1#mn1:49.1-mn1:50.4). ",
      "sn1.20:25.3": "From the previous comment it should be clear that hope is entirely redundant to the task of developing Nibbāna (of giving up craving). Passion in regard to phenomena is always a present affair, and whenever it is either further maintained and acted out of, or abandoned, it is always *presently*. In this sense the Dhamma does not involve time, which is what the deity is asking the Buddha to explain. ",
      "sn1.20:25.5": "That which would’ve been called “him” has been clearly understood as another describable aspect within the five aggregates, and that’s why “he”, *qua* independent self, [cannot be found anywhere within the experience](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn22#mn22:36.4), not because he *destroyed* that which would’ve ordinarily been designated as “him” if he were not an Arahant. The latter is annihilationism and involves time, thus it’s not the Dhamma. [Undermining the Sense of Self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIDVvlTYxIc) "

I’ve chosen this to prevent confusion with the commentarial conception of a “sign” (a mystical mental image) that appears at some point during absorption meditation. The simile shows how in reality this _nimitta_ is something that’s *already there*, but is easily overlooked since it doesn't manifest in a direct, straightforward fashion, hence “hint”. The principle behind it is best illustrated by the [_cittānupassanā_ section of MN 10](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:34.1-mn10:35.4). ",

      "sn47.8:3.6": "Given the context, “having subdued” (_vineyya_) just above refers to a basic level of withdrawal from the coarse activities involving longing and aversion, not only physically and verbally but mentally as well (in the sense of not crudely revolving around sense pleasures, worldly distractions, etc.). That coarse, blatant layer of hindrances is as much as the unskilled bhikkhu can surmount, as he fails to notice the more general and refined compulsions still underlying his very attempt to abandon the defilements. ",
      "sn47.8:4.1": "Just as the unskilled cook would be serving his master with dishes based on his preconceived, abstract judgment of what he would fancy (“How could anyone not like this curry?”), so too the unskilled bhikkhu would operate with the tacit assumption that his attempt to practice _sati_ (or pursue any facet of the Dhamma) is inherently wholesome, failing to see that the quality of any action originates from the presently arisen [ intention behind it](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/). Because of this, he does not realize that what he is “feeding” his mind with those efforts (which are well and good *on paper*) is intentions of a subtler, albeit still defiled nature. He thereby unwittingly—yet by virtue of his own present attitude that he could give up at any time—maintains his mind in an agitated state despite actively striving for the opposite effect.

Keeping one's virtue properly already develops some basic recognition of the “hints” of the mind, since it requires being mindful of the motivation behind one's every action and not just adopt external behaviors that align with the letter of the precepts. In exactly the same way, the skilled bhikkhu is always clear and vigilant about the present motivation behind contemplating the body, etc.—seeing whether it's affected with restlessness, anticipation, aversion, impatience, and similar—and his efforts are not just directed at the *content* of that contemplation. ",
      "sn47.8:8.1": "The right “food” for the mind is not found through “experimenting” to see what will give rise to the greatest meditative bliss. It's impossible for that intention not to be accompanied by the very first hindrance of longing (_abhijjhā_), and the abandoning of such obvious tendencies is presupposed even in the unskilled bhikkhu. The right pleasant abiding results from the complete abandonment of craving, and this is achieved through cultivating the intentions that are _known_ to be fully free from passion, aversion, and distraction.

      "sn56.30:0.3": "This short discourse has profound implications:<br><br>(1) It highlights how it’s not correct to think that one has access to the right way of practice (the noble eightfold path) from the beginning, and that by following it one understands the other truths and becomes a stream-enterer. Only a *sotāpanna* or higher can be said to rightly understand the practice, and the Buddha [defines the “stream” that one enters into as precisely the noble eightfold path](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn55.5#sn55.5:2.5-sn55.5:2.7). This ties in with the fact that [only at that point has one sufficiently discerned the roots of the wholesome and the unwholesome](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9#mn9:3.1-mn9:3.2), and it’s only on the basis of that comprehension that the path can be followed. Adhering to a prescribed definition of the path and its factors can only circumstantially clear away specific types of unwholesome behaviors, while [their root](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-cues-of-the-mind/) remains unclear. Hence, without right view, there is no truly right intention, right speech, right action, etc., but only a superficial emulation of them.<br><br> (2) Similarly, not only here but always, the third noble truth comes before instead of after the fourth. This underlines how the eightfold path is made right and noble because one has *already* understood the cessation of craving—which is not a one-off extraordinary experience but a perpetually accessible knowledge—and one is thus able to strive for their intentions, speech, actions, livelihood, etc., to be devoid of craving, and that is what makes those factors *right*.<br><br>(3) We must not assume that we all understand what suffering is from the start, since that would entail knowing what the escape is too.<br><br>(4) Whenever it seems like various divergent practices and approaches are equally viable in leading to the cessation of suffering, it is because one’s conception of what suffering and craving are is excessively vague. Just as with a mundane problem or ailment, the less clearly one understands it, the more options will appear to be viable solutions. But one who understands the problem fully will know that there is only one way to solve it. This is why a noble disciple [does not waver at all](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn56.40) in their view of the practice; they are not stubborn or close-minded out of hubris.<br><br>(5) Two differing practices inherently entail two differing ideas of what the problem and its resolution are, because any treatment is born out of what the illness is, even implicitly, thought to be. The various topics of right mindfulness taught in the Suttas—the brahmavihāras, the four *satipaṭṭhānas*, etc.—are not different practices as such, but avenues through which the very same treatment can be applied. That is to say, they must all be underpinned by [the same understanding of the Four Noble Truths](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn28#mn28:2.1-mn28:2.4). For instance, if it is to be a part of the path, one cannot engage in [_mettā_](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/pervading-the-world-with-friendliness/) with a view that confuses unpleasant feelings with suffering—a view that is there whenever the fabrication of pleasantness is conceived as a solution. Instead, it must be a practice of giving up craving *in regard to* disagreeability that is arisen on its own, since that is what ill will actually is. "

The fact that the regarding is an “activity” (_saṅkhāra_) does not imply that giving it up is a simple act of will. That _saṅkhāra_ is there precisely because one by and large does not understand _saṅkhāras_ as they are, hence _saṅkhāras_ are dependent on the simultaneous presence of _avijjā_ in _paṭiccasamuppāda_. It is therefore [only with the destruction of _avijjā_ that saṅkhāras cease](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-nature-of-ignorance/)—*immediately*. Whenever a separate volitional act of giving up is needed for a _saṅkhāra_ to stop, that _saṅkhāra_ is necessarily a secondary symptom of appropriation, not the appropriation itself. Moreover, _saṅkhāras_ are not revealed as a result of a direct attempt to recognize them; they become evident in the course of the Gradual Training. The ability to pick up the [“sign of the mind”](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.68) is the same as the ability to recognize these fundamental _saṅkhāras_. ",
      "sn22.81:5.8": "On the topic of dependent origination, see [MN 38](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38) and [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67). It's self-evident that a temporal process or sequence of arising is not what's being discussed here, in which case it wouldn't be possible to understand all these phenomena as dependently originated *after* they have arisen. [AN 10.62](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.62): “No first point of craving for being can be discerned, before which it was not, and afterwards it came to be.” ",
      "sn22.81:5.12": "And for one who *doesn’t* know and see in this way, the influxes remain intact, no matter in what elaborate ways they manipulate the arisen form (feeling, perception, intention, or consciousness). The influxes are there precisely because of _not knowing_—concretely, of course, not just in theory—that there is nothing in the experience, not even craving, that can exist apart from the five aggregates. Whether that not-knowing manifests in the form of submitting to the pull of the craving, or trying to eliminate it altogether or [“manage”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndwMKAszWM) it is secondary; both fail to address the problem at its root, and the underlying assumption that the aggregates fundamentally _can_ be interfered with continues.",
      "sn22.81:10.8": "[AN 10.93](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.93)",
      "sn22.81:12.10": "In order to understand the nature of doubt (and any other hindrance) in this way and thereby cut it off at its root, one _must_ be ready to indefinitely [withstand the emotional pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XKSVuKe8_c) it will exert. If one cannot do that, it betrays the fact that one still tacitly regards the discomfort of the doubt, be it as acute as it may, as being somehow more than a [feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIx1EmVYbbc). This is why virtue, the practice of not acting out of unwholesome pressures, is the mandatory foundation for right understanding, even though it does not in itself give rise to such knowledge. See also [this passage](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn48#mn48:8.12-mn48:8.13) and its notes."

Prior to that, one’s effort must be aimed at  understanding what the path is, not to practicing it, just as the goal for someone who is new to weightlifting should be to learn the right technique, not to lift heavy weight. The same applies for all the other wholesome factors the Buddha described: the seven awakening factors are *attained* by the stream-enterer (47.30), the five faculties are present only in a _saddhānusāri_ at least (SN 48.12), who is [already a noble one by definition](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn34#mn34:10.1-mn34:10.2), and the four right strivings are only possible if one has properly understood the root of the wholesome and the root of the unwholesome, [which is the defining quality of a _sotāpanna_](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9#mn9:8.1-mn9:8.2).

This is important because the passage would otherwise be stating that the object must be vanquished from one's field of awareness altogether, but this is not achievable through volition. An intention of suppression and denial can be exerted only for as long as that which is being suppressed is still there, even if faintly, which means that such attempts are ultimately founded upon a fallacy. Furthermore, if the outright elimination of an arisen experience were the goal, there would be situations where success would simply not be possible: when sense objects are being forced upon one by the external situation (e.g., loud music playing in the vicinity). But in SN 35.239, restraining the senses is compared to directing a chariot in whichever way one wants, which illustrates how perfect sense restraint is always possible regardless of the current circumstance—regardless of the fact that the six senses and what comes through them is not ultimately in one's control (SN 4.19).

      "sn35.70:5.1": "Passion and any other defilement cannot be “in” the perceptions and feelings associated with sense objects. It is rather an intentional attitude superimposed over them: a vague *impulse towards action*, either by body, speech, or thought, simultaneous to feelings and perceptions. ",
      "sn35.70:5.2": "“Internally” there is no passion even when intense feelings arise in relation to sights if there is no inclination to act. See AN 6.55 and [SN 35.228](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.228). In this sense, one's own feelings and moods are seen as “external”, no matter how intimate and personal they feel. Hence the destruction of the defilements [hinges solely on the presence of understanding](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81), as ignorance is the fundamental root of all, and has nothing to do with the content of experience.

The _senses_ like or dislike their objects. But what can and should be given up, dispelled, eliminated, and obliterated is the intentional [desiring of that which arises as desirable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttVxzlzlj0), first and foremost at the level of bodily and verbal actions.

      "sn35.97:0.3": "This Sutta clearly highlights how _samādhi_ is not a state of concentration or absorption, but the result of sense restraint. In SN 35.247, it is shown how sense restraint eventually brings the six senses to a calm state where they no longer vigorously pull towards and away from agreeable and disagreeable things, and that relief from the prior volatility of one’s own senses is where the pleasure of _samādhi_ is born of. Even though there is a bodily component, it’s a side effect and not the source of the wholesome mental state. The previous Sutta, [SN 35.246](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246), has a similar description. See [this writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e2hztc/on_thinking_about_jh%C4%81na_by_ven_thanissaro/) for more on how jhāna is actually described in the Suttas. ",

      "sn35.97:2.18": "Since _samādhi_ is an abiding in a broader perspective—a state of being *separated* from things as the first jhāna description goes—one gets to see the more general aspects of one’s experience that were usually overlooked and thus automatically regarded as “me” or “mine” due to one’s engagement with particulars. The eye gets automatically imbued with the significance of being “me” when one is overly focused on particular sights. This is how one gets to discern the five aggregates [as far as they extend](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246#sn35.246:4.24), which is the complete opposite direction of becoming absorbed and looking even closer at particular instances of form, feeling, perception, etc. "

The Buddha's instructions not to take things as “mine” and to “let go” are misused as strategies to suppress and ameliorate feelings.<br><br> Instead, the right, imperturbable freedom is born of being ready to withstand *whatever* the six senses throw at one, and this is the measure of having understood one’s entire experience, top to bottom, as not-self, as opposed to the common trap of using the idea of not-self as a coping mechanism. <br><br> It should be noted that one starts out not seeing the full extent of the “tide”, in the same sense as a _puthujjana_ doesn’t see suffering, the first noble truth.

      "sn36.6:0.3": "[“Difference Between Ariya and Puthujjana”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkwYOroXqK0&pp=ygUeaGlsbHNpZGUgaGVtcml0YWdlIGFycm93IHN1dHRh) ",
      "sn36.6:1.3": "The two statements above set the context of the entire Sutta, and make plain that the first arrow (that which is shared by both individuals) is feeling in general, not “physical feelings” only, as it's sometimes interpreted. _vedanā_ denotes the affective quality of something, and not bodily sensations. Confusing the two wreaks havoc on the Dhamma. Sensations are _saññā_, and are limited to the 5th sense base; pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feeling is _vedanā_, and this arises in regard to every sense base (MN 148), including the sense of touch. Cutting themselves can feel pleasant and satisfying for some people, and being caressed by someone can be upsetting in some situations, showing how any given sensation can be _felt_ either pleasantly or unpleasantly. ",
      "sn36.6:1.7": "“kāyika” (bodily) here tends to be mistranslated as “physical”, implying that it refers to painful sensations. But the term for physical pain in Pali is _sārīrika dukkhā vedanā_, used for instance in the context of enduring heat, cold, harsh words of others etc. (e.g., AN 3.49). _kāyika_ refers to the six-sense base/five aggregates as a whole. For instance, SN 22.1 classifies “affliction in body (_kāya_)” as deterioration of *any* of the five aggregates, whereas “affliction in mind (_citta_)” is caused by appropriation being present when the aggregates deteriorate. The feeling arising from the death of a loved one or from an unpleasant mood would thus also be “bodily”, i.e., pertaining to the five aggregates. An extra layer of suffering in the _citta_ will be there on top of that when notions of ownership regarding the aggregates are present, and that is the second arrow. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMl8C1ViL1c) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9WZzxqAkE) for clarification on _citta_, which in this Sutta is best left untranslated to avoid confusion with _mano_ (see next comment). ",
      "sn36.6:1.13": "The word _cetasika_ here is key and rules out any suggestion of a contrast being made between the five physical senses and the sixth sense, which is _mano_, not _citta_. That _citta_ is not the same as _mano_ is illustrated by Suttas like AN 6.55, where it’s stated that the Arahant’s _citta_ remains unperturbed despite intense phenomena arising for _mano_. ",
      "sn36.6:1.14": "—[and that is the sole reason why they suffer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8R1za5f9sI) That resistance is the inevitable result of the implicit sense of ownership that a _puthujjana_ does not know how to overcome (_sakkāyadiṭṭhi_ or personality-view). Only with the view that one is in a privileged position of control—of being somehow “outside” and “above” the five aggregates and thus being able to manipulate them freely—is resistance conceivable. ",
      "sn36.6:1.18": "The pleasure of sensuality serves as a “cover up” to avoid facing the displeasure and dissatisfaction [that would be there otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Q94MYr3Qc). ",
      "sn36.6:1.21": "A discussion on [“neutral” feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow4u4hHQwL8). ",
      "sn36.6:2.3": "Since this depends on the understanding of the nature of feeling, which is gained only with the [Right View](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%209), there is no way for a _puthujjana_ not to be struck by the second arrow if an unpleasant feeling has arisen. If a _puthujjana_ is not suffering on a given occasion, it has to be because the present *feeling* is not actually unpleasant, even if the *perceptions* (bodily sensations) involved are things that would make most people suffer. An example of this would be soldiers, whose tolerance of intense physical sensations is way above average. Their tolerance of _feeling_ is an entirely different matter, however, which is why they aren't any closer to becoming noble disciples than normal people. ",
      "sn36.6:3.9": "The first two types of noble disciples, the stream-enterer and once-returner, are still subject to the fetter of sensual desire, and so they theoretically can experience craving for sensuality on occasions of heedlessness. But the difference remains that for them, that pleasure would no longer be used as a tool to escape and cover up an unpleasant feeling, as they know that this is futile, and they also know the actual escape. Their sensual craving, despite still being a defilement from an Arahant's point of view, is not accompanied by the vast amounts of delusion and self-deception with which the ordinary person would seek sensual pleasures. ",
      "sn36.6:3.11": "The escape is nothing but the cessation of craving against the feeling _while_ it persists, hence the metaphor of being “unyoked” just below. Replacing an unpleasant feeling with a different feeling, the principle of [“management”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndwMKAszWM) that the majority of contemporary practices revolve around, is not at all an escape. It results in simply being “yoked” to something less unpleasant for the time being, and it's essentially about evading the first arrow so as to circumstantially prevent the second one. ",
      "sn36.6:4.1": "“Not feeling a feeling”: as said above, the feeling is there, but the noble disciple is “unyoked” from it. "

The meaning of this section is not that all cognizable things disappear altogether, which would be illogical to present as the only right meditation. What this passage means is that the mind is not “established” in any of these things while they are there (described also at MN 138 as “scattered and diffused consciousness”), and this is already the case in the first jhāna. For a detailed treatise on what this entails, see [“The Meaning of Yoniso Manasikāra”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf).

This is because _jhāna_ does not take place at the level of the _content_ of one's experience, not even, as stated here, the objects of the mental faculty (_mano_). Simply put, jhāna is the unification of the mind (_citta_) on a certain overarching attitude, purified from unwholesome inclinations, that is independent of the content of the six senses; the only constraint being that in the first jhāna there cannot be speech, in the second there can be no thinking and pondering, and so on (SN 36.11).

Simply by not rightly understanding for himself, as it is, that no experience can ever be something other or “more” than form, feeling, perception, intention, and consciousness, both for _puthujjana_ and _Arahant_ alike, the former is subject to defilements. The defilements are “adventitious” because ultimately they too cannot be something _apart_ from form, feeling, perception, intention, and consciousness, but because that is not understood by the _puthujjana_, the defilements are there. (This is the meaning of the famous utterance of the Bāhiya Sutta, “In the seen, just the seen”, which does not refer to to some sort of “bare awareness” where parts of the aggregates have been cut off—an expectation that plainly indicates the presence of the very ignorance in question). When this is understood, there is no room whatsoever for passion, aversion, or muddledness of any kind (let alone the actions and misconduct that would result from them). [“Why Are You Not an Arahant Yet?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xcPXgsuIsU).

      "an4.162:0.3": "This Sutta debunks the notion that whether one’s practice is pleasant or unpleasant is a matter of choice. It is a matter of the degree of defilements one carries. In the [very next Sutta](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an4.163), the pleasant practice is defined as the jhānas. What emerges from this, and from various other discourses—[AN 6.73](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73) and [AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=AN9.42) being prominent among them—is that the jhānas only come into the picture after a significant amount of work of freeing the mind from defilements—a task that, as shown by instances like [MN 14](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14) and [AN 3.94](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.94), is not completed by virtue of even stream-entry (it is in fact the _sakādāgami_ for whom the three defilements have inherently lessened). A tangible measurement of the degree of defilements one has is how resistant the mind is to strict virtue, celibacy, and sense restraint, and there is no shortcut by which a mind that resists renunciation can get to experience it as joyful, i.e, attain jhāna, just as a wild elephant cannot be tamed out of the blue (MN 125).",

      "an3.121:3.7": "Note how purity is not defined as the simple absence of these things (which can happen out of circumstance or accident). The principle behind this counterintuitive situation is that when these states have been fully understood (i.e., _avijjā_ is destroyed), they cannot be called “hindrances” anymore. They are hindrances when there is craving, and without ignorance craving cannot exist, even amidst the things that used to provoke it. To use an analogy, if someone has the key for the cell door and knows for a fact that they can get out at will, can that really be called imprisonment? The Dhamma applies to and must be realized solely within oneself, which in turn means that one is either hindered by these things because there is craving and ignorance in one’s own mind, or one isn’t. Thus it would be wrong to say “the hindrances are not _actually_ hindrances” as if it were a universal truth independent of one’s point of view. "

So a person must bring themselves to that point at least, regardless of whether they formally ordain or not, before any of this even applies. Otherwise, it would be like placing raw gold ore directly into the crucible, without removing the crude impurities first. ",
      "an3.101:2.2": "Note that genuine abandonment of impurities in the way described here can only occur when one is willing to relinquish them indefinitely, without deciding in advance to re-take them at a later time. Granted, from a third-person point of view one can say that the impurities will most likely return and can only be permanently dispelled by the attainment of non-return or higher, but from the _internal_, first-person, perspective of the mind that is being presently purified, they are being given up “forever“ if they are actually being given up at all.

In the case of psychic abilities, these might not be available no matter how far one's _sati_ has been developed through samādhi, as was the case for Ven. Sāriputta and others. As for Arahantship, the same principle applies: Nibbāna can be “remembered” as a phenomenon if the things that obstruct it have been sufficiently cleared out and the most general aspects of experience become evident, and this would also take place through the development of _samādhi_ (which broadens and expands the mind as opposed to narrowing it down, as would tend to be expected).

      "an10.93:0.3": "The Right View stands out from all others in that it is the understanding of the nature of *all* views (including itself, by virtue of being the understanding of the five aggregates). That said, there is a wide gap between being able to describe the Buddhist view on theoretical grounds, similar to Anāthapiṇḍika here, and having widened the scope of that understanding so that it’s not simply a new standpoint that replaces the previous ones. That is why the wanderers’ accusation that Anāthapiṇḍika clings to his view of dependent origination would be perfectly valid if he had not, as he replied, understood the escape beyond even that view while still holding it—that is, if he were not a stream-enterer. Hence, both [_yoniso manasikāra_](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf) *and* the utterance of another are [indispensable for attaining the Right View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yptLIdi1JW8), as stated in [MN 43](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn43#mn43:13.1-mn43:13.4).

But we see in MN 136: “_moghaṃ kāyakammaṃ moghaṃ vacīkammaṃ, manokammameva saccanti_”, and this doesn’t mean that bodily and verbal actions are “false”, but that they are of little importance compared to mental action. It makes much more sense to interpret _idameva saccaṃ..._ in the same way, since all throughout the Suttas we find the Buddha [claiming that only his teaching is right](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn11#mn11:2.1-mn11:2.3), and that there is only one way to complete freedom from suffering.

      "an10.62:1.1": "This disproves the rather prevalent understanding of ignorance of craving as somethingthat arises at distinct “moments” of our experience and that can be dispelled as a matter of choice. Craving is a much subtler phenomenon than the particular, blatant urges that almost anyone can recognize in themselves, and that is why seeing what craving is to begin with—and understanding that it’s the root of suffering—is *noble insight*, not common sense. ",
      "an10.62:2.9": "The five hindrances are found at the level of one’s overarching attitudes towards the world and behaviors that are exhibited on a regular basis. This is why it is misguided to think they can be “suppressed” during discrete “sessions” of concentration practice—or rather, it’s misguided to think that “suppression” of hindrances is the goal to begin with. One’s actions no longer being driven by the pulls of the hindrances is the goal, not the complete suspension of all action, and one’s overall lifestyle cannot possibly be exempted from those efforts. This is why the abandonment of hindrances is a late stage of [the Gradual Training](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn107).

      "an10.62:2.21": "This is a succinct but momentous statement: if one lacks faith in the right instruction, no matter how much one has made sense of _yoniso manasikāra_ on an intellectual level, whatever one takes the “origin” (_yoni_) to be will not actually be the origin, and that is especially the cease if the prerequisites regarding restraint of behavior have not been met. _Yoniso manasikāra_ requires going against the grain of the mind’s tendencies in order to actually qualify as such; it requires leaving no stone unturned. Faith—the willingness to put any view or conviction one might have second to the external instruction—is the only thing that can prevent one from stopping short of that. One’s reasoning is inherently biased by ignorance, and thus, it alone cannot overcome _avijjā_. ",

One is immeasurably closer to the four satipaṭṭhānas by keeping the precepts and cultivating virtuous and restrained behavior than by concentrating on one’s breathing sensations X amount of hours per day.

It's important to note that the value to cultivate is that of renunciation, not of the first jhāna directly. This is because, from the perspective of a mind not free from sensuality, even the ideas and expectations of the first jhāna would be infected with the same hindrance of longing (_abhijjhā_). One must therefore relinquish *all* expectations of pleasure and invest all the effort in clarifying the peril of sensuality (having already stopped the actual _engagement_ with sensuality way beforehand through virtue and restraint), and the right type of joy will arise on its own as a result of that. See the [simile of the hen and the eggs](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn16#mn16:27.2-mn16:27.6). ",

This means that the perceptions of the pleasant objects of the five senses are, contrary to popular belief, very much still there. But there is an “opening” due to the internal dispassion that has been cultivated beforehand and is still enduring (by [contemplating the affliction](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn19)) inherent in those pleasures). That is also what is meant by “*separated* from sensuality …” (_vivicceva kāmehi_). For this same reason, the mind _will_ fall back into sensuality if the dispassion is neglected, and the same principle applies to the subsequent jhānas as seen below. ",

Each jhāna could be regarded as the contemplation/reflection (the literal meaning of _jhāna_) of the unsatisfactoriness of the state that preceded it, and that reflection is the basis where the mind is “unified” (_ekaggatā_).

      "an9.42:4.2": "This contradicts the view that in the first jhāna one becomes unaware of the domain of the five senses and is *therefore* said to be “separated from sensuality”. Furthermore, the statement is not just that one is confined within the perception of objects of the five senses and that these simply become devoid of their agreeability. No, one is confined within *things that are desirable*. A thing is desirable because of how one’s own senses are disposed towards it, not because it belongs to some imaginary public set of things that are deemed as such. And that desirability is not in one's control, but it's also not in itself sensuality, as stated in AN 6.63. One must therefore train one's mind [to become disenchanted with the very wanting of the senses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttVxzlzlj0). That is the “opening amid confinement”, in contrast to directly trying to force the senses to not find things agreeable—an endless and ultimately misguided endeavor. "

      "mn35:4.5": "_saṅkhāras_ are, strictly speaking, neither the simplistic “choices”, nor the abstruse “fabrications/volitional formations”. They are “movements” in the most general sense, but they need not always be fully deliberate. For instance, a _puthujjana's_ misconceiving of the aggregates as “mine” is a _saṅkhāra_ ([SN 22.81](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81)), but because they're unable to recognize that attitude as a _saṅkhāra_—and thereby straight away as impermanent, in which case they would irreversibly cease to be a _puthujjana_—that “activity” continues to take place. It is therefore not possible to simply choose not to take things as self: that _saṅkhāra_ is neither a “choice” nor an “intention”. ",
      "mn35:15.5": "This doesn't mean that choice and will do not exist. It means that they are always *subordinate* to the aggregates. By taking medicine, one *might* successfully cure an illness and thereby modify one's form, but the fact remains that it's always possible for all of one's attempts to fail. That is because form has the final say; one can at best, to use an analogy, submit proposals to it. ",
      "mn35:16.7": "One can seek all sorts of entertainment and distraction to alleviate an unpleasant feeling that has arisen (which is always mental and should not be confused with physical sensations), but it's always a gamble as to whether it will work. That is why people can, for example, remain depressed even though they are actively trying to get out of that state. ",
      "mn35:18.8": "We have the capacity to make certain choices only because the possibility of making them was given to us beforehand, whatever the reason may be. For instance, someone who is incapacitated cannot engage in the activity of moving their affected limbs; they at best engage in the activity of *thinking* about moving their limbs, and that is something different. ",
      "mn35:19.8": "Consciousness in the modern sciences is defined in various ways that are incompatible with the five-aggregate scheme, as they often end up mixing it up with the other four aggregates. In the Buddha's teaching, there is not one consciousness; each sense base has its own consciousness ([MN 38](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38)). _viññāṇa_ is simply the fact that the other four aggregates and instances of them (or a sense experience with the six-sense scheme) are being experienced, with each distinct phenomenon possessing its own consciousness. So the statement that one does not wield power over consciousness means, in simple terms, that one cannot decide to be aware of things that one is not aware of, or to not be aware of things that one is already aware of. Even a choice to go and find out more about something would require being aware about that something in the first place, at least in imagination. ",
      "mn35:20.11": "It's important to see that _anattā_ is the result of seeing impermanence and not-self: things are *unfit* to be regarded as “mine” because of their inherently unreliable nature, and *not* because the things themselves somehow “do not ultimately exist” or “are never the same for two successive moments”, which is pure mysticism not found anywhere in the Suttas. One develops the insight of _anattā_ by understanding that appropriation is a _mistake_ that requires training and diligence to rectify, and not by taking on an intellectually pleasing belief that the self is “merely an illusion”. ",
      "mn35:20.17": "_anicca_ is not about our experience being in constant flux, in which case it would not follow automatically that whatever is _anicca_ is _dukkha_. There is no reason why perpetual novelty must be inherently unpleasant. One must start these contemplations not from a theoretical stance aiming to ascertain the metaphysical “true nature of reality”, but from a concrete and personal point of view of acknowledging one's attachments, emotional dependences, and appropriations. Seeing impermanence in that context automatically entails suffering, and that makes it impossible (when seen rightly) to keep taking things as “mine”. ",
      "mn35:25.2": "“Liberated through non-assumption” describes how an Arahant is freed from suffering not because they have somehow altered or “fixed” their experience—including their feelings—but because their mind is disenchanted with the aggregates regardless of how they manifest. See [SN 35.228](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.228). "

      "mn49:2.2": "Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: ",
      "mn49:2.3": "‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or reappearing. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’ ",

      "mn49:4.1": "When he had spoken, I said to him, ",
      "mn49:4.2": "‘Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! ",

      "mn49:5.3": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, bhikkhu, who condemned and loathed earth, water, air, fire, beings, gods, the Progenitor, and Brahmā. ",

      "mn49:5.7": "So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: ",

      "mn49:5.9": "If you do, then you’ll end up like a man who, when approached by Lady Luck, would ward her off with a staff; or who, as he’s falling over a cliff, would lose grip of the ground with his hands and feet. ",

      "mn49:7.2": "‘But, good sir, what I say is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable is in fact permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. And where I say there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or reappearing, there is in fact ",

      "mn49:25.1": "Some scholars believe that this line was not in fact spoken by the Buddha but by Brahmā, and that it refers to a meditative attainment that falls short of Nibbāna. But this is clearly not in keeping with the context, since Brahmā would be claiming to have understood something that lies beyond his range, while right in the preceding statement and before that too, he stubbornly expressed disbelief in such a possibility.  The non-indicative consciousness referred to here is not a mystical, altered state that is accessed through meditation, but a structural principle inherent to the five aggregates that needs to be [_discerned and understood_](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an1.51-60). It is not a separate dimension where the things listed here disappear altogether (which is impossible; there can be nothing that's outside of “the All” or the five aggregates). It's simply that when all traces of passion have been given up, the mind no longer “partakes” in things even as they manifest in full force (AN 6.55). The simile the Buddha employed on different occasions was that of a lotus that remains unsullied by the water that surrounds it (AN 4.36, AN 10.81). SN 12.64 compares it to a ray of light finding nowhere to land on (the point being that [the ray itself is still there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-039SYi2a94)). In reference to the same principle, [AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42) uses the analogy of an opening _amidst_ confinement. This surmounting of phenomena while they endure is the purpose of the [four _satipaṭṭhānas_](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10). ",

      "mn53:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. ",
      "mn53:2.1": "Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. ",
      "mn53:2.2": "Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: ",
      "mn53:2.3": "“Bhante, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. ",
      "mn53:2.4": "May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it. ",
      "mn53:2.5": "That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.” ",
      "mn53:3.1": "The Buddha consented with silence. ",
      "mn53:3.2": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, ",
      "mn53:3.3": "bowed, stood to one side, ",
      "mn53:3.4": "and told him of their preparations, saying, ",
      "mn53:3.5": "",
      "mn53:3.6": "“Bhante, please come at your convenience.” ",
      "mn53:4.1": "Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. ",
      "mn53:4.2": "The Saṅgha of bhikkhus also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. ",
      "mn53:4.3": "The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. ",
      "mn53:5.1": "The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda, ",

      "mn53:6.1": "Then Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan: ",
      "mn53:6.2": "“Mahānāma, there is the case where a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue, guards the sense doors, is moderate in eating, and is dedicated to vigilance. They have seven good qualities, and they get the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. ",
      "mn53:7.1": "And how is a noble disciple accomplished in virtue? ",
      "mn53:7.2": "It’s when a noble disciple is virtuous and lives restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper behavior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they train in the training rules. ",
      "mn53:7.3": "That’s how a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue. ",
      "mn53:8.1": "And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors? ",
      "mn53:8.2": "When they see a sight with the eye, they don’t grasp at signs and features of it ",
      "mn53:8.3": "on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on them. They practice to restrain that; they guard the eye faculty and bring about the restraint of the eye faculty. ",
      "mn53:8.4": "When they hear a sound with the ear … ",

      "mn53:8.10": "That’s how a noble disciple guards the sense doors. ",
      "mn53:9.1": "And how is a noble disciple moderate in eating? ",
      "mn53:9.2": "It’s when a noble disciple eats reflecting through the origin: ",
      "mn53:9.3": "‘Not for entertainment, indulgence, beautification, or adornment, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support the renunciate life. In this way, I shall put an end to old feelings and not give rise to new feelings, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ ",
      "mn53:9.4": "That’s how a noble disciple is moderate in eating. ",
      "mn53:10.1": "And how is a noble disciple dedicated to vigilance? ",
      "mn53:10.2": "During the day, a noble disciple cleanses their mind of obstructive states while walking or sitting. ",
      "mn53:10.3": "During the first watch of the night, a noble disciple cleanses their mind of obstructive states while walking or sitting. ",
      "mn53:10.4": "During the second watch of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—recollected and aware, having set the intention to get up. ",
      "mn53:10.5": "Having gotten up in the last watch of the night, they continue to cleanse the mind of obstructive states while waking or sitting. ",
      "mn53:10.6": "That’s how a noble disciple is dedicated to vigilance. ",
      "mn53:11.1": "And how does a noble disciple have seven good qualities? ",
      "mn53:11.2": "It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ",
      "mn53:11.3": "‘That Blessed One is an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
      "mn53:12.1": "They have a sense of shame. They’re ashamed of bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and ashamed of acquiring any bad, unbeneficial qualities. ",
      "mn53:13.1": "They have a sense of remorse. They are remorseful of bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and remorseful of acquiring any bad, unbeneficial qualities. ",
      "mn53:14.1": "They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the [right] meaning and phrasing, and which describe a renunciate life that’s entirely complete and pure—such teachings he has learned much of, remembered, rehearsed verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view. ",
      "mn53:15.1": "They live with effort roused up for giving up unbeneficial qualities and embracing beneficial qualities. They’re resilient, vigorous, and not slacking off when it comes to beneficial qualities. ",
      "mn53:16.1": "They’re recollected. They possess utmost recollection and judiciousness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. ",
      "mn53:17.1": "They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. ",
      "mn53:17.2": "That’s how a noble disciple has seven good qualities. ",
      "mn53:18.1": "And how does a noble disciple get the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty? ",
      "mn53:18.2": "It’s when a noble disciple, quite disjoined from sensuality … abides having entered upon the first jhāna. ",
      "mn53:18.3": "second jhāna … ",
      "mn53:18.4": "third jhāna … ",
      "mn53:18.5": "fourth jhāna. ",

      "mn53:19.1": "When a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue, guards the sense doors, is moderate in eating, and is dedicated to vigilance, has seven good qualities, and gets the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme safety from the yoke. ",
      "mn53:19.2": "Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that chicken doesn’t wish, ",
      "mn53:19.3": "‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ ",
      "mn53:19.4": "Still they can break out and hatch safely. ",
      "mn53:19.5": "In the same way, when a noble disciple is endowed with all these factors, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme safety from the yoke. ",
      "mn53:20.1": "Relying on this supreme purity of recollection and equanimity, that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives. ",
      "mn53:20.2": "That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

      "mn53:20.3": "This is their first breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell. ",
      "mn53:21.1": "Relying on this supreme purity of recollection and equanimity, that noble disciple, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how beings are reborn according to their actions.

      "mn53:22.1": "Relying on this supreme purity of recollection and equanimity, that noble disciple abides having entered upon the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding that is devoid of influxes, having for themselves comprehended and realized it right in the present experience. ",

      "mn53:25.1": "This noble disciple is said to be ‘accomplished in knowledge’, and also ‘accomplished in conduct’, and also ‘accomplished in knowledge and conduct’. ",
      "mn53:25.2": "And Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse: ",
      "mn53:25.3": "‘The aristocrat is best among people ",

      "mn1:1.1": "",
      "mn1:2.1": "The “root” being described is not a metaphysical concept, but simply ignorance in its all-pervasiveness. The purpose of the discourse, and the reason for the extensive repetition, is to show that no experience that an ordinary person has will occur apart from the “root” of conceiving. Therefore, there is no “experience“ or perception, no matter how grand, that is fundamentally capable of making any difference to that “root“. <br><br> What one must develop is the understanding of the nature of all experiences, which completely transcends their specific *content*. From the point of view of that higher knowledge, no experience is any more “special“ than any other. This thorough and all-inclusive dispassion is what can be called Nibbāna, and not any of the specific things that may arise within it.",
      "mn1:3.1": "The “true persons” are the noble individuals, who have understood and acquired the Noble Eightfold Path (SN 45.26, [SN 55.5](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn55.5)). ",
      "mn1:3.2": "[Perception is Already Ignorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZvqDJlxvxc) ",
      "mn1:3.3": "“Perceiving” and “conceiving” here do not refer to layering concepts and notions over the “raw” experience. An experience of an “ultimate reality” that is supposedly free from concepts would be affected by the ordinary person’s conceiving just as much as any regular experience. The problem was never the content of experience, and so the solution cannot not lie there either. ",
      "mn1:3.5": "",
      "mn1:25.1": "i.e., anything and everything. The six internal sense bases coupled with their external counterparts constitute everything, or “the All” (SN 35.23). ",
      "mn1:26.2": "Even a so-called “glimpse of Nibbāna” would be contaminated by the very same conceiving. It would arise from the same “root”, as it is simply another perception whose *nature* is not understood, no matter how extraordinary, groundbreaking, or revelatory it appears to be. ",
      "mn1:27.1": "A “trainee” is a noble one who is not yet an Arahant (SN 48.53). “Comprehends” (_abhijānāti_) means that the noble disciple rightly knows the entire “scope” of any experience. While for an ordinary person, a tacit taking of some ill-defined part of the picture as their Self always lingers “the knower”, “the doer”, etc.—even if they fully “agree” with the doctrine of _anattā_ and deliberately refrain from labeling anything as “I” or “mine”. A trainee fully understands even that subtle “inner end” that a _puthujjana_ takes as their Self to be equally within the experience of earth, water, etc. If that which *could* be taken as self is, instead of denied, seen to fall squarely *within* the experience regardless of seeming privilege over it, then it is impossible to take it as an extra-spatial and extra-temporal master of the same experience. That assumed mastery is what the wrong view of self really boils down to, not to whether that which *can* be taken as the Self/master really exists or not. ",
      "mn1:27.2": "The trainee, due to his understanding, has the choice to dispel all conceiving. Persevering in that is how they would eventually become fully and irreversibly established in the Deathless. ",
      "mn1:75.4": "Passion = _rāga_. “Greed” is _lobha_, which is coarser and oriented more towards external things, whereas “lust” has sexual connotations. _Rāga_, on the other hand, is very general, including even the _arūparāga_ still present in a non-returner, who is by definition already free from greed and lust. ",
      "mn1:123.4": " “Muddledness” corresponds better to _moha_ than “delusion”, which tends to signify an incorrect belief regarding a specific state of affairs. “Delusion” in the context of Dhamma (meaning crudely wrong beliefs like eternalism) is more of a side effect of the lack of clarity (muddledness) regarding the nature of one’s experience, which is why simply being told the way things truly are and accepting the right views intellectually, thereby ceasing to be “deluded”, is not enough to remove _moha_. ",
      "mn1:147.4": "All Arahants fully understand their experience to the extent necessary to be completely free from suffering, but the Buddha understands the nature of things even beyond that point. "

      "mn27:15.2": "Sense restraint should not be confused with “sense deprivation”. The 6 senses will inevitably have to encounter agreeable and disagreeable objects, and the practice is to simply not allow one's attention to the pleasant objects to be motivated by longing, and the attention to the unpleasant objects by aversion. This is best illustrated with eating: agreeable flavors will be experienced, but one can make sure not to lose the context of [what the practical purpose of eating is](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2#mn2:14.2). The same applies when encountering any other sense object; whatever motivation lies behind attending to it, it should never be longing or aversion. If those are not present, there is no issue. But there is reason why in the Gradual Training sense restraint comes after virtue and precepts: it is impossible to commit the actions outlined in the section just above without states of longing and aversion being present. ",
      "mn27:15.7": "I translate _mano_ as “mental faculty” so as to not create confusion with _citta_, which is not the same. See for instance AN 6.55: the _mano_ of an Arahant can be assailed by oppressive phenomena, but their _citta_ would always remain unmoved. _mano_ is said to be Māra's property, while the _citta_ can be trained to no longer fall under his control ([SN 35.246](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246))."

At the same time there is likely a play of words: _khīla_ means stake or post, and so, the sense of something that is fixed and immovable is also being conveyed, referring to the bhikkhu being unwilling to change his mind about some gripe or another regarding the teaching, hence I've chosen the rendering “obstinacy (examples of this are found in [MN 22](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn22#mn22:3.19), [MN 38](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38#mn38:3.11), and MN 65). A person can be as tender and kind as they please while still harboring these obstinacies internally, and the opposite is true as well—case in point being Ven. Mahākassapa, one of the foremost Arahants who in the eyes of most people today would've qualified as “harsh” (SN 16.11). (Additionally, even if the intended word was _khīla_ and not _khila_, three long syllables in a row are usually avoided in Pāli, leaving us still with the same _cetokhila_.) ",
      "mn16:13.1": " The first three obviously don’t imply that one needs to be a non-returner in order to make progress in the Dhamma, but that one certainly must have abandoned *actions* rooted in passion for sensuality, the body, and form. That is the only way to increase one’s capacity to understand the Dhamma (i.e., abandon the five hindrances, see AN 10.61 on what causes the hindrances). Those who already have a sufficient capacity (with “little dust in their eyes”) can understand it without a long period of developing restraint beforehand, like many householders of the Buddha’s time who attained stream-entry upon their first encounter with the teaching. For whomever it does not happen that way, there is “dust” that needs to be cleared up through the abandonment of passion for these three things, as it clearly indicates that one cannot presently understand the Four Noble Truths despite having more information about them than the average attained layperson in the Buddha's time probably did. See [“Stream Entry for Laypeople”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AWxZnxeYk). ",
      "mn16:26.1": " _iddhipāda_ > basis of spiritual ability. “Psychic power” is inappropriate because that's only one side-effect of developing the _iddhipādas_. The Buddha always taught them chiefly for the sake of liberation, which is a spiritual ability too, and the only one that is guaranteed to come from developing these things. "

      "mn4:29.2": "With the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, I saw beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how beings reappear according to their actions: ‘These beings engaged in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They found fault with the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These other beings, however, engaged in good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They did not find fault with the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, I saw beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how beings reappear according to their actions. ",

      "mn4:31.1": "When my mind had become composed like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of defilements, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it towards the knowledge of the destruction of the influxes. ",
      "mn4:31.2": "I understood as it is: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. ",

      "mn4:32.1": "Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was liberated from the defilements of sensuality, being, and ignorance. ",
      "mn4:32.2": "When it was liberated, I knew it was liberated. ",
      "mn4:32.3": "I understood: ‘Birth is destroyed, the renunciate life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no more of this.’” ",
      "mn4:33.1": "This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the final watch of the night. ",
      "mn4:33.2": "Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is heedful, diligent, and resolute. ",
      "mn4:34.1": "Brahmin, you might think: ",
      "mn4:34.2": "‘Perhaps the Master Gotama is not free from passion, aversion, and muddledness even today, and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ ",
      "mn4:34.3": "But you should not see it like this. ",
      "mn4:34.4": "I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. ",
      "mn4:34.5": "I see an easeful abiding in the present experience for myself, and I have compassion for future generations.” ",
      "mn4:35.1": "“Indeed, Master Gotama has compassion for future generations, since he is an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha. ",
      "mn4:35.2": "Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! ",
      "mn4:35.3": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyesight can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways. ",
      "mn4:35.4": "I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. ",
      "mn4:35.5": "From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” "

      "mn26:15.13": "It is evident that the teaching of Aḷāra Kālāma was more than just a contemporary concentration method or system. As said above, there were things to be learned and *comprehended* in that teaching, and the _bodhisatta_ had a sense that there was a deeper form of “knowing and seeing” than what he had so far achieved. In MN 106, the *reflection* that leads to the extent of nothingness is described, and it is likely that Aḷāra Kālāma's teaching centered around something similar to that, but that he was the only one in the group who was able to not only preach those principles but also gain the corresponding _samādhi_. ",
      "mn26:16.13": "The contemplation that leads to this attainment is given in MN 106, and AN 10.29 describes that view as “the highest among outsiders”. Again, as with Aḷāra Kālāma above, this teaching was about more than just some arbitrary concentration “technique”. It was a _dhamma_, a principle/phenomenon to be understood and realized. Further below, both of his former teachers are declared by the Buddha to have “little dust in their eyes”. ",

      "mn26:19.4": "_idappaccayatā_, lit. “dependence-upon-this”. This is a principle of simultaneous dependence. It's about knowing the underlying foundation of one's experience while that experience is there so that the appropriation of it ceases. _paṭiccasamuppāda_ is not an explanatory, pseudo-scientific description of how our experiences come to be or are in some sort of continuous “flux”. In [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67), Ven. Sāriputta employs the simile of two sticks standing in (simultaneous) dependence upon each other to describe _paṭiccasamuppāda_.

Establishing one's mind in the extent of nothingness, as Aḷāra Kālāma did, entails going well beyond the threshold of abandoning sensuality, which is the first jhāna. That is why he would've easily understood it. See also AN 9.47. ",
      "mn26:33.1": "See [AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42). One is “confined” within the five strands of sensuality, i.e., for as long as one is alive, *something* will have to be experienced as pleasant and alluring. So the only true escape is *within* the confinement: learning how to be dispassionate and seeing the danger in the midst of those things ([MN 25](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=MN25)). However, this doesn't mean that it is possible to perform _actions_ of sensual nature while still partaking in the escape; see the wrong view proclaimed by Ariṭṭha in [MN 22](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=MN22). It also doesn't mean that a hectic environment loaded with temptations is not an impediment for one whose mind is still not liberated from sensuality ([MN 36, the simile of the wet sticks](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn36#mn36:17.1-mn36:19.12)). Only in seclusion does one begin to see what the “snares” really are (AN 6.63). "

This illustrates how the _āsavas_ come *into* instead of *out of* the mind, which is implied in “outflow” or “effluent”. The mind of the ordinary person however does not *become* contaminated with _āsavas_, but rather has been so always, without a beginning (AN 10.61, SN 48.50). Only after understanding _yoniso manasikāra_, and thereby gaining the Right View, is it possible to overcome the influxes, as stated here. ",
      "mn2:3.3": "_yoniso manasikāra_ and _ayoniso manasikāra_. For an in-depth treatise, [see my essay on the subject](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf). ",

      "mn2:5.3": "This is not as straightforward as focusing on certain objects and avoiding others. That should be quite evident from the context, since if it were as simple as that, there would be no need to *understand* what things need to be attended to and why, i.e., what is _kusala_ and what is _akusala_, the knowledge which sets apart a noble disciple from an ordinary person ([MN 9](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9)). It would be a matter of adhering to a prescribed set of instructions mechanically. ",
      "mn2:6.2": " One directs one’s mind in such ways precisely because one is not aware of oneself doing so. One might even think that the current direction of attention is wholesome because the topic is superficially “good”, while in reality the deeper motivation for it is affected with defilements. <br><br> The reason for not knowing what to attend to and what not to attend to is not a lack of learning, but a lack of familiarity [with one’s own mind](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-cues-of-the-mind/). ",
      "mn2:7.3": "It's not that the one would necessarily ask themselves these specific questions repeatedly, but rather that *ayoniso manasikāra* would make one at least implicitly regard the *premise* behind such questions as important. That premise—namely, that possessing answers and information is akin to wisdom or insight—is what’s wrong. The celebrated teaching of “mind-moments” is an example of a (futile) attempt to answer such questions, and originates from _ayoniso manasikāra_.",

The unlearned ordinary person does not understand this as it is; therefore I say that for the unlearned ordinary person there is no development of the mind.”“Limpid, bhikkhus, is this mind, and it is freed from adventitious defilements. The trained noble disciple understands this as it is; therefore I say that for the instructed noble disciple there is development of the mind.” —AN 1.51-52. <br><br> It is only with this understanding as foundation that the other 6 categories of influxes below can be abandoned. ",
      "mn2:11.1": "_Dukkha_ is not to be found at the level of particular objects and experiences (which is why liberation from suffering amid disagreeable experiences is possible), but in one’s “background” attitude of resisting them. Hence, that attitude can only be recognized and the Four Noble Truths understood if one has learned how to attend “through the origin”, by means of which the full subtlety of craving can eventually become apparent, and the right view attained. ",
      "mn2:11.3": "_sīlabbataparāmāsa_: “Clinging to rites and rituals” is certainly an instance of this, but a very coarse one that doesn't require stream-entry to be given up. _parāmāsa_ means “grasping” or “holding” in general, not “misapprehension”, as it’s sometimes glossed. ",
      "mn2:12.2": "Sense-restraint hinges entirely on _yoniso manasikāra_, and therefore even that basic practice (as well as all further ones below) can only be implemented rightly by a noble disciple, who has sufficiently understood attention through the origin.

      "mn7:5.33": " Having accomplished this means already being a noble one. As stated in [MN 2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%202) and [MN 9](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%209), only one with Right View knows defilements and the way to abandon them. ",
      "mn7:6.2": "The Dhamma is always said to be “evident” (_sandiṭṭhika_) in the Suttas. This doesn't mean that the Dhamma is trivially easy to see; quite the opposite. But it means that it is not found “elsewhere”, i.e., apart from what is already in the present experience. It is not found in mystical states or perceptions that need to first be brought about through a concentration practice. One whose mind is in _sammāsamādhi_ sees things *as they are* ([AN 10.2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.2)). Translating _yathābhūta_ as “as they _really/truly_ are”, implies a hidden reality behind appearances that needs to be discovered in order to see the Dhamma, in which case it would not be _sandiṭṭhika_. See [SN 35.70](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.70). ",
      "mn7:11.2": "This is all it should take for _samādhi_ to arise according to the Suttas ([AN 10.2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.2)). The contemporary methodical meditation practices are never mentioned. [“How Virtue Leads to Effortless Samadhi”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOIYwY39eE) ",
      "mn7:13.1": " _mettā_ comes from √mitt which just means “be friendly”, and mittā is “friend”. “Love” as in “loving-kindness” would correspond to _pema_—a defilement, a form of delight in pleasant feeling that is in direct conflict with liberation from suffering, and the _brahmavihāras_ are one of the many approaches the Buddha gave for the abandonment of “love”. That is why the highest and most refined of them all is equanimity/indifference. See the essay [“Pervading The World With Friendliness”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/pervading-the-world-with-friendliness/) ",
      "mn7:14.1": "_pharitvā viharati_ is normally rendered as “he lives pervading…” or “keeps pervading…”, with the idea that it’s about selecting specific individuals or groups of people one by one and “spreading” kindness to them. The Pāli, however, says “he abides having pervaded…”, which is quite different (the absolutive does not actually ever denote true simultaneity). It’s not a “process” or sequential method revolving around specific beings, but a general attitude of non-ill-will that is established all at once, and that one must then abide protecting and maintaining, “like a mother would protect her only child with her life” (Snp 1.8). For that, one needs to understand what that general, all-encompassing attitude is, not just mechanically try to arouse pleasant feelings towards individuals—a practice which will be underlain by a general attitude of craving. It will not truly be a _brahmavihāra_, no matter how nice it feels. ",

      "mn8:1.1": "On the basic level, this Sutta is about being willing to do what one knows is in line with the Dhamma even if the whole world does the opposite. There's a lot more to it than just that, however, which can be inferred by the Buddha’s injunction at the end, which he would give only in the context of a very profound teaching. The more fundamental message of the Sutta is about learning to see one’s own mind (_citta_) as another person (compared to a wild untamed elephant in MN 125), and recognizing that no matter what bad habits and tendencies try to re-assert themselves or what mental states come up, nothing is stopping one from adopting a right attitude despite them (which is how one purifies the mind, instead of trying to control it directly). As the last part says, one can only tame another if one is tamed oneself. Namely, one can only tame one’s mind and make it imperturbable if one is oneself not falling prey to its moods, whether through welcoming or through resistance. That is how, counterintuitively in a sense, the mind would cease to exert control over one, and defilements would be ‘worn away’ correctly. See [SN 1.1](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn1.1), and [“Becoming Imperturbable”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-039SYi2a94) ",

      "mn28:6.1": "A brief note on the four elements or _dhātu_: this is not a framework for explaining the external word in the manner of science or physics, but a characteristic of every arisen phenomenon in one’s experience— which is to say, of everything in the ultimate sense. A scientist’s *experience* of studying or observing physical forces, states of matter, or subatomic particles has the four elements as its foundation. Consequently, as explained further down in the discourse, even mental phenomena have a component of form or _rūpa_—which is defined in terms of the four elements—just like of all the other aggregates. ",
      "mn28:6.7": " One should see that there is no fundamental difference between the two. The internal form, upon which one’s whole life depends, is not somehow more permanent or reliable than the external one. ",
      "mn28:8.5": " If there were no earth element making up the ear, or any other sense base, there could be no _phassa_. The latter is thus also impermanent. See the comments in [MN 18](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn18). ",
      "mn28:9.8": "This is the attitude that’s in accordance with the recognition that the internal earth element does not have a privileged position to the external one. It’s not about *trying* to experience bodily pain however, but about a mental context of dispassion that would not budge no matter what happens to the body. ",
      "mn28:26.1": "Again, the point here is that there is no miraculous reason why it couldn’t at any time fall apart just like a building. ",
      "mn28:27.1": "The “corresponding engagement” (_tajjo samannāhāro_) is automatically there in a mind with _avijjā_ (_avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā_). With that engagement, there is the corresponding consciousness (_saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ_). If there were not that ignorance nor the engagement/_saṅkhāras_ that automatically comes with it, there would be no manifestation of the _five assumption-aggregates_, i.e., there would be no _dukkha_. It is because of this that a _puthujjana_ must regard Arahantship as something inconceivable from their present point of view: it is the utter cessation of the five assumption-aggregates (which are _sakkāya_ or “personality”, MN 109), which is to say, the cessation of everything that makes them what they are. Only the stream-enterer who sees _paṭiccasamuppāda_ and its cessation knows how to put an end to the five assumption-aggregates so that only the five aggregates remain. ",
      "mn28:28.10": "Such a bhikkhu sees paṭiccasamuppāda and the cessation of suffering, so he’s at least a sotāpanna. The same applies whenever this last phrase occurred previously in the Sutta. "

What's taking place here is an attitude of ”bad faith” or [“inauthenticity”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32K94HGsDHQ)—a deeply rooted, not entirely deliberate refusal to acknowledge the truth of one's situation, more specifically the fact that while one might be upholding the ideals, behavior, and even practices of one who is striving for liberation, internally one still chooses not do one's best in abandoning *all* forms of passion, aversion, and muddledness, and also not feeling a sense of compunction that would at least pull one of out that attitude eventually. See [MN 5](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%205). ",
      "mn29:5.42": "“Knowledge-and-vision” (_ñāṇadassana_) refers, in colloquial terms, to “insights”. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the attainment of a groundbreaking insight that makes one a stream-enterer, even if it’s accurate, and thinking that it is leads to taking for granted significant traces of wrong view that still remain. As said in [MN 1](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1#mn1:26.1-mn1:26.4), even a genuine insight or apprehension of Nibbāna—which is not a mystical state or experience, but simply the absence of passion—lies within an _puthujjana’s_ reach. <br><br> A stream-enterer or higher does have the criterion to discern what true freedom from suffering (“the heartwood”) is like, and therefore they could not mistakenly settle for something that falls short of it. They would at best be procrastinating the work they know they have left, for up to 7 lives at most. ",

      "mn3:3.2": "And there was some extra almsfood that was going to be thrown away. ",
      "mn3:3.3": "Then two bhikkhus were to come who were weak with hunger. ",
      "mn3:3.4": "I’d say to them, ",
      "mn3:3.5": "‘Bhikkhus, I have eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I need. ",
      "mn3:3.6": "And there is this extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away. ",
      "mn3:3.7": "Eat it if you like. Otherwise I’ll throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.’ ",
      "mn3:3.8": "Then one of those bhikkhus would think, ",
      "mn3:3.9": "‘The Buddha has eaten and refused more food. ",
      "mn3:3.10": "And he has some extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away. ",
      "mn3:3.11": "If we don’t eat it he’ll throw it away. ",
      "mn3:3.12": "But the Buddha has also said: ",
      "mn3:3.13": "“Be my heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things.” ",
      "mn3:3.14": "And almsfood is one of the material things. ",
      "mn3:3.15": "Instead of eating this almsfood, why don’t I spend this day and night weak with hunger?’ ",
      "mn3:3.16": "And that’s what he would do. ",

      "mn3:3.21": "Why don’t I eat this almsfood, then spend the day and night having got rid of my hunger and weakness?’ ",
      "mn3:3.22": "And that’s what he would do. ",
      "mn3:3.23": "Even though that bhikkhu, after eating the almsfood, would spend the day and night rid of hunger and weakness, it is the former bhikkhu who is more worthy of respect and praise. ",
      "mn3:3.24": "Why is that? ",
      "mn3:3.25": "Because for a long time, that will lead to that bhikkhu’s fewness of wishes, contentment, wearing away [of defilements], unburdensomeness, and arousal of effort. ",
      "mn3:3.26": "So, bhikkhus, be my heirs of the Dhamma, not of material things. ",

      "mn34:10.2": "See the SN 25.1-10. The _dhammānusāri_ and _saddhānusāri_ are already noble individuals, said to have “arrived at the fixed course of rightness” and “transcended the plane of ordinary people”. Possessing the five faculties of a noble one (SN 48.12), they are destined for enlightenment in the same way as a stream-enterer, because they are guaranteed to become one before they die. This does not at all refer to the average practitioner, no matter how committed they are, and it would be a grave mistake for anyone to assume themselves to be at this stage. The caveat is although the statements summarizing the Buddha's teaching found throughout SN 25 are things that every faithful Buddhist would “agree” with, an ordinary person necessarily misconceives those statements in one way or another, and thus, technically, the teaching that they're avidly devoted to is *not* the Buddha's teaching even though they take it as such. Hence, they do not qualify as a faith-follower. "

I accepted no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drank no beer. ",

      "mn12:49.2": "As long as my own urine and excrement lasted, I would even eat that. ",
      "mn12:49.3": "Such was my eating of most gruesome things. ",
      "mn12:50.1": "I would plunge deep into a frightening forest grove and stay there. ",
      "mn12:50.2": "It was so frightening that ",
      "mn12:50.3": "normally it would make the hairs of whoever were not free from passion stand up if they entered it. ",
      "mn12:50.4": "And on days such as the cold spell when the snow falls in the January winter, I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by day. ",
      "mn12:50.5": "But in the last month of summer I’d stay in the open by day and in the forest by night. ",
      "mn12:50.6": "And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me: ",
      "mn12:50.7": "‘Scorched and frozen, ",

      "mn12:50.10": "the sage still pursues his quest.’ ",
      "mn12:51.1": "I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow. ",
      "mn12:51.2": "Then village louts would come up to me. They’d spit and urinate on me, throw mud on me, even poke sticks in my ears. ",

      "mn37:3.5": "There is a double meaning to the expression _sabbaṃ dhammaṃ (abhijānāti)_, which has been rendered as either “all things” or as “everything”, even though it's clearly singular unlike the _sabbe dhammā_ just above. The phrase can point simultaneously to how this statement is the essence of the Buddha's teaching, and also to the phenomenon (_dhammaṃ_) of “the All” (_sabbaṃ_) described in other Suttas (SN 35.23, SN 35.80). Not discerning the full extent of experience—a state maintained chiefly by a lack of development of sense restraint—automatically entails being moved by feelings and trying to manipulate them. Note that “knowing the full extent of experience” is not about some finding some hidden secret, but about ceasing to ignore things that are already there. A prime example of it would be not overlooking the [intention behind one’s actions](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/)—not trying to expand one’s awareness of inconsequential perceptions like sounds and bodily sensations.

      "mn21:20.1": "It's not that an Arahant would experience no mental displeasure as a result of this experience. Mental displeasure is _dukkhavedanā_, and the aggregate of feeling (which should never be confused with “sensation”) still remains in an Arahant. So this is not only saying that one should be unmoved by the physical pain alone, but by the mental one too (AN 6.55, [SN 35](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.228).228). If anything, it is the mental displeasure that causes an ignorant mind to become corrupted with aversion. When people encounter severe physical pain while in state of euphoria, it does not arouse aversion in them. On the other hand, even minor pains can cause a person in a bad mood to lash out in anger.

The point is that one shouldn’t expect something else apart from one’s own volition to make or help one abstain from bad actions. Often there is the idea that virtue and good behavior should come as a result of meditation rather than the other way around, and that’s often rooted in the expectation that restraint should be easy. But the development of mind that matters lies precisely in no longer being bothered by displeasure and difficulties, not in ceasing to have them. ",

      "mn20:3.1": "It is crucial to note that this doesn't mean one eliminates the unwholesome thoughts simply by overriding the entire arisen experience with a different one (e.g., moving one's attention to sensations of breathing to stop all mental activity). It means that while the overall experience of the mind being provoked by the respective perceptions still remains, one makes the effort to emphasize other aspects within that same experience that do not serve as fuel for the unwholesome. In this way, the mind actually gains perspective over the assailing phenomena, such that it is no longer passionate, averse, or muddled despite their presence. Replacing the pressuring phenomena altogether, which is generally the tacit goal in contemporary meditation methods, only serves to cover up the problem, and it does not at all fit the simile given of knocking out a coarser peg with a subtler one. See the comments in [MN 18](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn18), and [“Seeing Through The Hindrances Instead of Denying Them”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDdMyOTylH0). ",

One can, however, at any given instant abandon *mental action*, and this is what is being referred to. [“Stop Thinking That You Can Stop Thinking”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsv9JLMh4e8) ",

[MN 53](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53) defines a noble disciple endowed with supreme _sati_ as “one who remembers what was said and done long ago”, and even in everyday life, it’s evident that remembering is *not* a matter of unbroken attention; otherwise, we would forget everything we don't focus on continuously, and we wouldn’t be able to keep an overarching goal in mind while switching between various subtasks. <br><br>It is this same quality of remembering, just applied aspects of one’s present experience that are relevant to freedom from suffering, that underlies each of the four _satipaṭṭhānas_. Not incidentally, the Right View is necessary for the Right Recollection: it’s impossible to recollect something that isn’t already known. <br><br>[“Focus”, “observation”, “watching” or “bare attention”,](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an11.9#an11.9:2.3-an11.9:2.17) on the other hand, require one to forget (ignore or overlook) the general aspects of one’s present situation—where ignorance, defilements, hindrances, and wrong views lie—in favor of particularities, and thus the domain where *both* calm and insight are to be developed is obscured. ",
      "mn10:3.2": "[“Seeing a Body Within The Body”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/), [“Putting The Body First”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB9dQFtXMKs). The locative case (_kāye_) conveys the sense of “within” as well as simultaneity, hence I’ve chosen “concurrently with the body”. _anupassī_ is a verbal adjective indicating an ongoing action, in this case of “seeing along with”, hence “maintaining perspective”. ",
      "mn10:4.0.2": "See [“How to Calm Your Mind”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg) and [“Mindfulness of Breathing and Calming of Aversion”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrgV9KI5LeI), available in written form in [Dhamma Within Reach](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/dwr/) and [The Only Way to Jhāna](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/new-book-jhana/) respectively. ",
      "mn10:4.2": "_parimukhaṃ_ > “at the fore”: This does not mean attending to the sensations of breathing at one’s nostrils, or anything of that nature. The same expression occurs for example in [MN 39](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39#mn39:13.1) and several other passages unrelated to _ānāpānasati_ that are about overcoming the five hindrances by reflecting on their troublesome nature.  _“parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā”_ simply means, both in those passages and here, that one makes the establishment of the perspective the priority. ",
      "mn10:4.3": " Literally: “with memory, he breathes in; with memory, he breathes out”. _sati_ here, as always, pertains to something that is *not* the particular in and out breaths. That is the principle behind all memory: having in mind, in regard to what is directly present, something that is *not* directly present. The subject of this memory is not the breathing itself, just as a memory about a cup that’s in one’s hand is not *in* the perception of the cup itself. ",
      "mn10:4.4": " Through this, one becomes familiar with how it’s ultimately the body that is responsible for breathing, as one does not get to decide whether the right type of breath at the moment is long or short. This reveals how the nature of breathing constitutes the true foundation for one’s experience, and not one's sense of control and preference. One can try to manipulate it and influence it, but it is apparent if one is honest that this is always secondary to the body, which holds the final say. This would eventually undercut one’s appropriation of the body if discerned to the sufficient extent, making one’s sense of control (and thus sense of self) be seen as circumstantial—meaning, there is a factual capacity for control, but since it’s subordinate and uncertain, it falls short of justifying any form of ownership and delight. [“Breathing Towards Death”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/breathing-towards-death/) and [Notes on Meditation](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/notes-on-meditation/). ",
      "mn10:4.6": "This doesn't mean expanding one's awareness to include more bodily sensations, as this instruction is sometimes interpreted. Such an exercise is irrelevant to the task of understanding the unconditional cessation of suffering. [MN 44](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn44#mn44:15.2) defines the _kāyasaṅkhāra_ as in and out breathing because “those phenomena are tied to the body”, and thus they serve to outline the entirety of what the body is. The entire six-sense-base, which is where any and all assumptions of ownership would find footing, is seen within the context of the act of breathing, as dependent upon it. This does not involve concentration upon the breath, but the exact opposite: while the six senses are directly experienced, whether while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, the act of breathing—seen to be in one’s control only relatively speaking—is known as the sustenance that they depend on. ",
      "mn10:5.2": " Only when the foundation that (one’s experience of) the body stands upon is recognized and discerned as impermanent can it become apparent how the body too is impermanent—how one has only very relative control over its growth, continuation, or disintegration. Impermanence is not revealed by observing the body direcly, since that observation would be limited to certain sense objects (e.g., tactile sensations) that are themselves dependent on the body.",

      "mn10:6.1": "Awareness of the current posture can be made the perspective from which anything at all is experienced. All one may be thinking about, no matter if its content is entirely divorced from the present situation, can be discerned as subordinate to the fact that one is currently seated, for instance. Sustaining that simple memory correctly, i.e., with _yoniso manasikāra_, while various phenomena continue to manifest is more than enough to abide “disengaged, not taking up anything in the world”. On the other hand, intently focusing on one’s footsteps while walking, the sensations of the knees touching the floor while sitting, etc., are exercises that revolve around shrinking one’s perspective. ",
      "mn10:8.1": " One who has awareness (_sampajaññā_) is defined in SN 47.35 as one who knows feelings, perceptions, and thoughts as they arise, remain, and cease. But this awareness would always have to pertain to the general, fundamental level of one’s experience (e.g., the thoughts and attitudes behind the desire to engage in a sensation-watching exercise when it arises, rather than the specific sense objects that would be apprehended through said exercise). ",
      "mn10:10.1": " This isn’t meant to be a mechanical visualization of the body parts. For it to qualify as a development of perspective, the *relationship* between the (unattractive) organs and the body (that one takes as attractive by default) must be discerned, while the two are present, as opposed to trying to override one with the other. As with all the other contemplations, the two aspects are on different levels—one is a memory about the present experience (the image of body parts) and the other is the present experience itself—“this very body”, which also happens to be perceiving, feeling, and thinking.

A feeling or _vedanā_ is the general pleasantess, unpleasantness, or neutrality of an experience, while sensations are perceptions (_saññā_, the third aggregate) of the fifth sense base (touch). Sensations/perceptions that would most of the time be felt unpleasantly can sometimes be felt as the opposite, depending on the situation where they arise. The lines further below that speak about “feelings not of the flesh (_nirāmisa_)” are the best proof of _vedanā_ not being sensations ",
      "mn10:32.6": "This corresponds to the pleasure of _jhāna_, which contrary to popular belief does not primarily originate from bodily sensations. It is born of the [mental relief of no longer being a victim to the five hindrances](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39#mn39:14.29-mn39:14.30), and that mental relief generates a bodily counterpart on its own. Making the mind calm by fabricating pleasure through somatic techniques is not that different from the mental release that comes from a massage, i.e., pleasure of the flesh. ",
      "mn10:33.4": " Each individual sense experience is necessarily accompanied by a feeling (SN 35.60), but on the whole, there is always one general feeling underpinning the whole of one’s situation. When that feeling is unpleasant, particular pleasures are not gratifying, and when it is pleasant, particular displeasures are not upsetting. By understanding that it is that general feeling (which is always “already there”) that determines one’s experience of the world, the never-ending project of trying to feel only pleasure and avoid displeasure is seen as futile, since even if the particular feelings can be manipulated by doing this or that, the general one changes of its own accord.

If this perspective is sustained, the mind will be purified of passion at its root, since lack of perspective is what’s responsible for all unwholesome states. They cannot induce themselves.

      "mn9:8.1": " _diṭṭh(ev)a dhamme_, lit. “within the seen phenomenon/thing”, an expression that occurs a few hundred times in the early texts, has often been translated as “in this very life”, “in the present life”, “here and now”, etc., but there are several instances where this would be quite meaningless.

      "mn9:11.4": " _phassa_ “pressure”: The standard “contact” is technically not inaccurate, but there is a tendency to think of it in an abstract way that leaves out one’s personal point of view, as if one can imagine _phassa_ (“touch”, more literally) without already “being touched” (affected by the arisen experience). Whenever there is _phassa_, there is necessarily feeling (_vedanā_), meaning that there is no such thing as “raw experience” which then somehow evolves into engagement and craving. Feeling and craving are *already there* whenever there is _phassa_ (see [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67) on how paṭiccasamuppāda is not a temporal “process” but a simultaneous interdependence of two phenomena).

      "mn9:30.2": " “Becoming” gives the wrong impression that _bhava_ is a matter of choice. But a decision to “not become anything” remains fully enclosed within the much subtler scope of _bhava_, especially if one is not a noble disciple. As said below, the cessation of _bhava_ comes about only through the Noble Eightfold Path. ",
      "mn9:34.1": "Assume: late Middle English: from Latin assumere, from ad- ‘towards’ + sumere ‘take’. _upādāna_: _upa_-‘towards’ + _ādānā_-‘taking’. Just as with “becoming” and _bhava_ noted above, “clinging” or “grasping” make it sound like _upādāna_ is a matter of choice. But _upādāna_ is there to the exact same extent that craving is there, even if one deliberately refrains from “clinging” to anything. Moreover, an assumption is something that cannot return once it’s abandoned, whereas clinging can come and go an indefinite amount of times. ",
      "mn9:38.4": "Craving is an automatic, inevitable result of feeling because the entire _paṭiccasamuppāda_ structure originates from ignorance. There is no possibility, even for a split-second, for there to be feeling but no craving for as long as there is _avijjā_, and same for every other pair of factors listed in the series. ",
      "mn9:46.4": "cf. SN 22.47, SN 35.232, and Udāna 2.4 “Pressures pressure one due to appropriation (_upadhi_)”. The sense fields (as well as everything else following _avijjā_ in dependent origination) no longer exist in an Arahant. They still perceive sights, sounds, etc., and still have five aggregates, but they cannot be said to possess the “same” sense fields or aggregates as an ordinary person minus a certain property, since ignorance distorts things in their totality. In other words, ignorance is not something *within* the sense fields; it's what makes the sense fields be how they are to begin with, such that whatever they encounter affects or pressures one, and as that pressure is felt, that feeling is craved for or against, etc. That is why _paṭiccasamuppāda_ has a certain order, even though it's not a temporal sequence and all factors are simultaneously present. ",
      "mn9:58.4": "“Activities” renders _saṅkhāra_, which literally means “(a) doing”. The customary “(volitional) formations”, “fabrications”, etc., can be  mystical/abstruse, while “intentions” is an oversimplification, and corresponds actually to _cetanā_, a specific type of _saṅkhāra_. <br><br>Regarding _saṅkhārā_ as fundamentally volitional is misleading, since the reason for their presence is not mere will, but ignorance (“With ignorance as basis, activities [exist]...“). Conversely, their cessation isn't reached by intentionally refraining from choice, but by fully dispelling ignorance (“With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, activities cease...”).

      "mn19:2.2": "[“Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBiB0W7U6FQ) ",
      "mn19:2.3": "A sensual thought is a thought that is underlain by a mental state of delight and passion, not a thought that is about something in the domain of the five senses, in which case almost every thought would be a sensual thought. That would be ludicrous, and is how one arrives at the idea that the only way to be free from hindrances is to suppress all thinking. The same thought—about, say, agreeable food—is determined as involving sensuality or not by the more general state of mind. This is why sometimes, if the mind is in a depressed or anxious state, thinking about the exact same things that used to excite the mind fails to do so. Therefore, just as with the hindrances, one needs to be able to recognize when there is sense-desire “internally”, as discussed in the [context of the satipaṭṭhānas](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:36.4), to be able to even recognize the sensual thoughts (and the rest) as described here, let alone to dispel them. See [“Sensuality VS Agreeability”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc9XWIZ64Wc). ",
      "mn19:2.5": "Translating _nekkhamma_ as “non-sensual” instead of “renunciation”, since the etymology is ambiguous and allows for either. “Non-sensual” fits better in this context, as thoughts of renunciation would involve active maintenance and involvement. See the discussion in the comments below. ",
      "mn19:3.4": " [“The Ultimate Method for Overcoming Hindrances”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9voIhZij5Io) ",
      "mn19:3.5": "This reflection is not a “one-shot” affair. The context of danger and harm needs to be fostered and more clearly discerned in order for the thoughts to subside. One knows the thought of sensuality, aversion or cruelty has subsided when one is freely able to think about the same topic without at all experiencing the mental state of desire, aversion, or cruelty. As stated at the end of the following Sutta, one who develops this sort of practice is able to “think whatever he wants to think and not think whatever he doesn’t want to think”, without any harmful mental states. ",
      "mn19:6.1": "“Along with” (_anu-vitakketi anu-vicāreti_) is a relevant nuance in the Pāli that seems to have been missed so far. The sensual thoughts and the rest will continue to arise in a myriad forms for as long as the mental state causing them is there, but one can incline the mind in the opposite direction so that eventually the mental state changes, by *not thinking along with* the harmful thoughts. This is different from simple-mindedly casting aside the *subject* that is giving rise to the sensual thoughts, which does not really address the underlying issue. See the comments in the [previous Sutta](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%2018). This is the “starvation” of hindrances that SN 46.51 refers to: _yoniso manasikāra_ towards the phenomenon that *provokes* the bad mental states, whereas _ayoniso manasikāra_ would be “thinking along with” the sensual thought, either by welcoming it or overly denying it. ",
      "mn19:7.5": "See the recurring passage about how the hindrances are surmounted by contemplating their detrimental nature, comparing them to debt, illness, imprisonment, slavery, and an uncrossed desert (e.g., [DN 2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn2#dn2:69.1-dn2:74.1) & [MN 39](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39#mn39:14.1-mn39:14.30)). ",
      "mn19:8.8": "This part is ordinarily thought to mean that to enter the first jhāna one must bring thinking to a halt because *all* thinking is tiresome and incompatible with peace. But the Pāli is _anuvitakketi anuvicāreti_, the same “thinking along with” already explained in a previous comment. What this is saying is that the active utilization of thinking for the sake of inclining the mind is tiresome, even though its certainly indispensable initially. Steadying the mind internally means making it so that actively contemplating (the “_anu-_” component) the danger in unwholesome states is not necessary to keep them at bay. It doesn't mean eliminating _vitakkavicāra_ altogether, which only occurs in the second jhāna. ",
      "mn19:8.11": " [“Jhāna Comes Only After Renunciation”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7DqygBzFlo) ",
      "mn19:9-10.12": "Compare this with its Chinese Āgama parallel, Madhyama Āgama 102 (pg. 259 of [this freely available PDF](https://www.bdkamerica.org/product/the-madhyama-%E2%80%82gama-middle-length-discourses-volume-ii/)). Most importantly, at the point where the Buddha realizes that continuously “thinking along” thoughts of renunciation, non-aversion, and non-cruelty would be tiresome, and decides to “compose his mind internally” instead, the Āgama parallel goes on to describe a state such that “thoughts in accordance with the Dhamma” were “allowed to arise” as opposed to intentionally cultivated, and that abiding in this way, the mind was no longer troubled. It is implied there that this state of mind—for which the same simile below of the cowherd only needing to “remember that the cows are there” is used—is in fact the first jhāna, as right after it, the Buddha enters the second jhāna. Further support for this is found in MN 78: the first jhāna is where sensual, averse, and cruel thoughts cease without remainder, whereas their opposites only cease in the second jhāna. ",
      "mn19:14.1": "Applied and sustained thought”, “directed thought and evaluation”, “placing the mind and keeping it connected”—none of these popular renderings correspond to the free-roaming _vitakkavicāra_ of the first jhāna. These are still the active _anuvitakketi_ and _anuvicāreti_ referred to above, whereas, ironically, those interpretations tend to be chosen because simple “thinking and pondering” is regarded as “too coarse” to be present in the first jhāna. The very reason why the first jhāna is peaceful is precisely because there is no need to “apply, place, direct…” or even “restrain” anything anymore, hence the simile of the cows roaming free and the cowherd having to do nothing but watch them from afar. Note that “verbal thinking” does not cease in the first jhāna, as is generally expected. SN 36.11 explains that what ceases is _vācā_, meaning speech itself. In [MN 44](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn44#mn44:14.2), _vitakkavicāra_ is said to be the “verbal activity”, understood in the sense that “having thought and pondered, one breaks into speech (vācā)”. Thus it is the “breaking into speech” on account of verbal thinking that ceases in the first jhāna, not the verbal thinking as such. ",

Furthermore, as said in [MN 48](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn48), it is the Right View that truly allows for harmony and success in a community. If the members of a commune don't possess Right View, then the harmony that is achieved will be superficial, and more often than not will come through covering up each individual’s personal responsibility and enforcing the undertaking of predefined habits and practices (_sīlabbataparāmāsa_). That’s not what’s being advocated here: in this case, since all three bhikkhus were Arahants, there would never be any fundamental fault with what what any of them was in favor of, and therefore there was no reasonable grounds for disagreement.

      "mn13:6.2": "Even though technically the term usually occurs as plural in Pāli, I have chosen to translate _kāma_ as “sensuality” throughout because it can accommodate both the instances when it refers more to desirable objects as well as when it refers to the desire itself. _kāma_ may be accurately translated as “pleasure”, while _sukha_, which can be of a wholesome kind such as that of _samādhi_, would instead be “ease”; the implication of the five senses is actually not present in the word _kāma_ itself, but in the definition of the five _kāmaguṇa_. However, as AN 6.63 says, the five strands of sensuality are not _kāma_; _kāma_ is one's *passionate intention* (_saṅkapparāga_). The _Kāmasutta_ (Snp 4.1) describes things like property, cattle, and wealth, which may not be considered not crudely “sensual”, as _kāma_. ",
      "mn13:7.4": "Note that a thing being likable, desirable, etc., is not a property of the object “out there in the world” that is publicly agreed as such by everyone. A thing's attractiveness is determined by one's own sense organs and the preferences they have circumstantially developed. “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”, as the saying goes. It is therefore necessary to make oneself fully dispassionate and unmoved regarding what one's senses happen to find agreeable, as opposed to removing the agreeability itself. The five strands of sensuality are called “confinement” in [AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42), and the true escape can only be found *within* that confinement. See [“Not Wanting the Wanting of Sensuality”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttVxzlzlj0). ",

      "mn13:18.1": "I've opted for the singular even though the Pāli is plural so as to not cause confusion with “forms” as the counterparts of the eye organ. ",
      "mn13:32.5": "i.e., a sense of safety from all threats. See the similes given for the abandonment of the five hindrances in [MN 39](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39). This is quite different from the popular conception of the pleasure of the _jhānas_, where the gratification comes from a sense of ecstasy (often centered around physical sensations) that has nothing to do with the _recognition_ that one is free from danger and affliction. The bliss is usually only possible through disabling one's capacity to reflect in the way that the Suttas say give rise to the right type of joy (_pīti_). There are a great many passages describing what actually leads to this joy, and it's not concentration techniques. A few examples: [DN 2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn2), DN 9, [DN 10](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn10), DN 13, [MN 7](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn7), [MN 15](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn15), [MN 39](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39), [AN 9.41](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41), [AN 10.2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.2).

In other words, whether it’s a baby or someone who claims to have “let go of all concepts” and fully abide in the present moment, personality-view (and all the others below) is _still occurring_ just not on as blatantly as for someone who also engages in crude actions and thoughts rooted in conceit and a sense of self. Absence of symptoms does not mean absence of the underlying illness. ",

[Liberation can only come from full understanding](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2#mn2:3.1) of the root illness and the escape from it, whereas the absence of its symptoms can come about by accident or skillful suppression. ",

This doesn’t mean one needs to keep “giving it up” each time it arises. It simply wouldn’t ever again arise _as defilement_ to begin with, and no action or response is required. ",
      "mn64:9.2": "There is sometimes a belief that one can be “attached” or “addicted” to jhāna. But the very first jhāna is reached precisely by putting aside all such attitudes. If there is attachment or addiction, one is not in fact disjoined from sensuality and unbeneficial phenomena even temporarily. As stated in [MN 44](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn44#mn44:28.3-mn44:28.4), the underlying tendency to passion for pleasant feeling does not underlie the first jhāna already, let alone the next ones. ",
      "mn64:9.3": "In the same vein, it’s not that this supposed to counteract a sense of “attachment” to the jhāna that would otherwise be there. It’s that simply not seeing those phenomena in this way, lofty as they are, entails a degree of ignorance. "

      "mn6:3.1": "  _Jhāna_ means “contemplation; reflection”, never “absorption” or anything along those lines. The word “meditation”, which derives from the Latin _meditari_, would in its original usage have been a good translation for _jhāna_. But the term has in modern times taken on a significance that is alien to the teachings found in the Suttas, and so I have chosen to leave it untranslated. The other somewhat accurate alternatives “contemplation, reflection” or similar may be misinterpreted as denoting simply abstract thinking and philosophizing. _Jhāna_ is the middle way between the one extreme popular today of absorbing oneself in the “present moment”, and the other extreme of abstract meandering divorced from one’s concrete present situation. Thus, _jhāna_ can be said to be about “concrete reflection”, and this would apply for all the _jhānas_ and even formless attainments, as evidenced by “reflection”(_paccavekkhanā_) in MN 106 being that which leads to every single successive stage of _samādhi_. See [this essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/what-the-jhanas-actually-are/) for more on the subject of _jhāna_ and the fallacies in the contemporary understanding of it. ",
      "mn6:4.1": " _ajjhattaṃ cetosamatha_ > internal calm of mind: The root √sam simply denotes “peace; calm”. “Stillness” can at times accompany peace, but they are by no means the same ([AN 3.63](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.63)), and motionlessness, whether of body or of mind, can well be underlain by defilements, and delusion chiefly. In _samatha_, the mind would be able to remain at peace internally even when there is activity and movement as long as it's not of an unwholesome kind. That is why it trains the mind in the permanent surmounting of suffering, as opposed to only providing a “break” from it. "

      "mn18:1.1": " [A discussion on this Sutta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfTM20wVhHg). ",
      "mn18:4.1": " “Non-contention” does not mean that the Buddha refrained from pointing out the fallacies in the views that were an obstacle to the liberation he realized (e.g., [MN 11](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn11), [MN 14](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14), [MN 22](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn22)). On being “underlain”, see SN 12.38. This is also what is meant with “harboring [a hindrance] internally, one meditates”, in MN 108, AN 11.8, and it's the aspect that the unskilled monk overlooks in [SN 47.8](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn47.8). This is the reason why the traditional approach to meditation is entirely inadequate: subtler intentions infected with hindrances will always be “underlying” the act of concentration, no matter how “one-pointed” it is. One ceases to be “underlain” by developing _yoniso manasikāra_, on which see [MN 2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2), and [this essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf). ",
      "mn18:8.1": " This is the controversial term _papañcasaññāsaṅkhā_, discussed in [this short essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/papanca-sanna-sankha/). “Proliferation” (_papañca_) here means something much more nuanced than simply an overuse of concepts and thinking. Allowing one's mind to overly dwell on the details of something would be a form of proliferation not because of the “amount” of thinking that is taking place, but if and when that thinking is accompanied by delight and craving. See the next comment. ",
      "mn18:8.2": " In other words, the problem is not that such things arise (thoughts and mental activities of an active and forceful nature), but that the mind is not dispassionate towards them. See AN 6.55, [SN 35.228](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.228), and the talk [“Becoming Imperturbable”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-039SYi2a94). ",
      "mn18:8.4": " It is the categorical end to all these things because one's dispassion and withdrawal no longer depends on any circumstances, including the intensity of the phenomena that arise at the six sense fields. In contrast to this, the natural tendency for the ignorant mind is to strive for freedom through the suppression of the besetting perceptions, such that, to use the simile from AN 6.55, the mind does not tremble because there is no storm, not because it's immovable. ",
      "mn18:12.3": "_jānaṃ jānāti, passaṃ passati_ > “knows while knowing; sees while seeing”. This is essentially the principle of _yoniso manasikāra_, and it's how the Arahant is not “underlain by perceptions” as said above. The Buddha's knowledge-and-vision does not simply occur at the level of attention and perception (e.g., extraordinary meditative experiences or visions), but at the level of understanding the nature of any and all perception while it takes place, regardless of whether it’s of a mundane or extraordinary kind (SN 22.59: “*all* perception, whether past, present, or future …”). ",
      "mn18:17.1": " The point of Ven. Mahākaccāna's explanation here is that, instead of trying to prevent the besetting perceptions from manifesting, one attends to it [“through the origin”](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%202), which means simultaneously keeping in mind the basis on which its entire manifestation depends, i.e. that the manifestation is inconceivable without that basis. This eventually results in the mind being unable to find anything to delight in within that experience, as the entire array of besetting perceptions is now seen as impermanent, conditioned by the eye, a lump of flesh that is fully liable to destruction. This is the right kind of equanimity, born of renunciation instead of circumstantial management of feelings (MN 137). This is how _paṭiccasamuppāda_ is concretely reflected on, how the [_satipaṭṭhānas_ ](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10) are practiced, and how the two extremes of indulgence and denial (of the besetting perceptions) are both avoided ([SN 1.1](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn1.1), SN 12.15): the Middle Way. ",
      "mn18:22.3": "i.e., a _bhikkhu_ with the Right View who is able to see _paṭiccasamuppāda_. The exposition would remind him that the work of overcoming the defilements is entirely doable, because it does not depend on something outside his control—whether the besetting perceptions arise or not. They inevitably will (SN 35.28, SN 35.240, SN 4.19). It depends solely on whether he sustains the right perspective in face of them, and that is fully in his control. "

Those are the [actions an Arahant is incapable of engaging in](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.7). <br><br>Believing that there is no harm in such actions is believing that there is no harm in suffering, thus it’s called a “pernicious view”. <br>As it happens, the view that the pursuit of sensual pleasures isn’t an obstruction to awakening is not difficult to encounter in modern Buddhist discourse. ",
      "mn22:27.1": "The true difficulty lies in concretely recognizing the full extent of the aggregates, not in the contemplation of _anattā_. This is why members of others sects who had already developed a high degree of _sīla_ and _samādhi_—un-absorption of the mind that uncovers the extent of one’s whole experience previously obscured by desire and passion—were able to gain the Right View and beyond quite easily. ",
      "mn22:37.5": "The view that the self gets annihilated does not need to be deliberately held, simply trying to deny one’s experience of a sense of self—instead of undermining it through the discernment of _paṭiccasamuppāda_ (see [MN 10](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10))—is enough to fall into this category. Most often, a view much the same in its nature as the third standpoint referred to in SN 12.18 is what is confounded with _anattā_. This is why, without the insight of impermanence and _paṭiccasamuppāda_ of a noble disciple, there is no alternative but to either accept or deny the self, both of which are mistaken (SN 12.15). "

Such seemingly harmless misconceptions do have the potential to [entirely derail one’s practice ([AN 10.105](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.105)). ",
      "mn38:8.15": "Sāti’s wrong view takes consciousness to be primordial, as if it's there first and things arise “within” it or “for” it (which is incidentally how it would tend to be conceived in modern thought, even among Buddhists). But consciousness is not a singular entity (nor is it “in the brain” and similar assumptions); _viññāṇa_ is one of the five aspects (five aggregates) inherent in _each phenomenon_. Also, note the simile: the burning of the fire is something that lasts for an indefinite duration of time (i.e., for as long as there is fuel). There is no such thing as an ever-changing stream of infinitesimal moments of consciousness. ",

Only if a phenomenon is still present is it possible to see its foundation (“nutriment”) as explained below. This is one of the many reasons why the view that experience can be neatly divided into sequential “moments” or “units” is fundamentally fallacious, and actually impedes the understanding of _paṭiccasamuppāḍa_. See the simile in [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67) illustrating how the latter is not a “process” or “chain” of causes and effects, neither on moment-to-moment nor a life-to-life scale.

The Right View is the irreversible understanding and familiarity with that principle that [undermines all views](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn8#mn8:3.1-mn8:3.6); it’s not the adoption of the “Buddhist outlook” of the world, which in itself can very well become yet another speculative answer to “Did I exist in the past?”, “What am I?”, etc. ",

      "mn134:0.2": "This discourse is widely known but its message is often misinterpreted. It’s not that one must become unaware of the past or the future—which is a matter of choice only on the superficial, not fundamental level—but that one must stop *delighting* in such thoughts. This is achieved through [yoniso manasikāra](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf). See also [“Gateway to Nibbāna”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XKSVuKe8_c). ",
      "mn134:3.5": "A phenomenon is a totality of all the aggregates, the present situation as a whole (“sitting alone in a room perceiving various agreeable or disagreeable mental images about the past or future”), and not just one specific object within that. ",
      "mn134:3.6": " One sees thoughts about the past or future *as present phenomena* too. This automatically prevents one from delighting in and getting pulled by them if done properly, without having to deny their presence. ",
      "mn134:3.9": "",
      "mn134:3.15": "Diligence is required to curb one’s own tendency to the wrong type of diligence: interference with arisen phenomena, most especially feelings. It’s not a matter of just relaxing and letting things be. ",
      "mn134:4.5": "It’s not just *one way* of practice; it’s the template for every type of mental cultivation because it’s the Middle Way: one does not indulge in presently arisen states, nor does one try to replace them (beyond the foundational setup of virtue and sense restraint, which needs to be there from beforehand). The four _satipaṭṭhānas_ are the practices to achieve this Middle Way: they serve as a foundation with which the arisen form, feeling, perception, intention, and consciousness can be allowed to be what they are without thereby falling into appropriation of them. If they are used as _objects_ to directly attend to, they simply replace the present experience, losing their entire purpose. When the Suttas speak about [“obliterating”](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2#mn2:20.1-mn2:20.2) unskillful thoughts, they refer to the stopping of one’s intentional engagement and proliferation of certain feelings and perceptions, not to the stopping of those feelings and perceptions themselves. The background “anchoring” that the _satipaṭṭhānas_ create, comparable to [a post](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/sujato?lang=en) to which wild animals are tied to as they continue to pull in different directions, is what prevents precisely this intentional engagement without thereby generating another one. Perseverance in this type of effort eventually leads to an [opening *amidst* the confinement](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.2-an9.42:4.2) of those same feelings and perceptions instead of providing one with an altogether different content of experience. ",
      "mn134:8-13.3": "The Pāli has a direct quote of the thought and says one does not delight *there*. It does not say one _doesn’t have_ memories about the past. ",
      "mn134:8-13.5": "This is ironically what’s happening behind the scenes whenever one attempts to suppress thoughts about the past or future, and fabricate more agreeable states in general. One internally longs for a particular type of experience that has not yet arisen, whereas the right cultivation is equanimity towards what is there *now*, as said in the verse. Obviously, there has to be a wholesome interest (_chanda_) in developing the mind, but that interest should drive one to abandon all longing (_abhijjhā_, the first hindrance), not to justify certain types of it. ",
      "mn134:8-13.9": "Similar to the above, it’s only because of still appropriating the five aggregates to some extent that one would seek to change their _content_, instead of cultivating the unfaltering recognition of the nature of whatever content is presently arisen. "
