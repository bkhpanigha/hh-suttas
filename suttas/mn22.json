    "mn22:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
    "mn22:2.1": "Now at that time a bhikkhu called Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful view: ",
    "mn22:2.2": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” ",
    "mn22:2.3": "Several bhikkhus heard about this. ",
    "mn22:2.4": " ",
    "mn22:2.5": " ",
    "mn22:3.1": "They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him, ",
    "mn22:3.2": "“Is it really true, Friend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful view: ",
    "mn22:3.3": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?” ",
    "mn22:3.4": "“Absolutely, friends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” ",
    "mn22:3.5": "Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the bhikkhus pursued, pressed, and grilled him, ",
    "mn22:3.6": "“Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. ",
    "mn22:3.7": "In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them. ",
    "mn22:3.8": "The Buddha says that sensuality give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the danger in them is what's greater. ",

    "mn22:3.19": "But even though the bhikkhus pursued, pressed, and grilled him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his view and insisted on stating it. ",
    "mn22:3.20": "When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the bhikkhus went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

    "mn22:6.15": "This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.” ",

    "mn22:7.5": "No, Bhante.” ",
    "mn22:7.6": "When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. ",

    "mn22:7.9": "I’ll question the bhikkhus about this.” ",
