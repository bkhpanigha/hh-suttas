  "sn56.30:0.3": "This short discourse has profound implications. For one, it highlights how it’s not correct to think that one already understands the right way of practice—the noble eightfold path—and that by following it one understands the other truths and becomes a stream-enterer. Only a *sotāpanna* or higher can be said to understand the practice, and the Buddha [defines the “stream” that one enters into as precisely the noble eightfold path](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn55.5#sn55.5:2.5-sn55.5:2.7). This ties in with the fact that [only at that point has one understood the roots of the wholesome and the unwholesome](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9#mn9:3.1-mn9:3.2), which is what allows one to [cultivate what needs to be cultivated and give up what needs to be given up](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an2.11-20#an2.11:2.1-an2.11:2.6). It’s also a mistake to assume that we all understand what suffering is from the start, since that would have to entail knowing what the escape is too. Furthermore, the only reason why it can often seem like various starkly different approaches to the practice can lead to the same cessation of suffering is because one’s conception of what suffering and craving are is excessively vague. Just as with a mundane problem or ailment, the less clearly one understands it, the more options will present themselves as viable solutions. And, ultimately, two different practices inherently entail two different ideas of what the problem and its resolution are. "
