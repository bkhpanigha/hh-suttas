  "sn35.70:5.1": "Passion and any other defilement cannot be “in” the perceptions and feelings associated with sense objects. It is rather an intentional attitude superimposed over them: a vague *impulse towards action*, either by body, speech, or thought, simultaneous to feelings and perceptions. ",
  "sn35.70:5.2": "“Internally” there is no passion even when intense feelings arise in relation to sights if there is no inclination to act. See AN 6.55 and [SN 35.228](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.228). In this sense, one's own feelings and moods are seen as “external”, no matter how intimate and personal they feel. Hence the destruction of the defilements [hinges solely on the presence of understanding](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81), as ignorance is the fundamental root of all, and has nothing to do with the content of experience.
