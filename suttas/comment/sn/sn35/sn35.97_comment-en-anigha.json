  "sn35.97:0.3": "This Sutta clearly highlights how _samādhi_ is not a state of concentration or absorption, but the result of sense restraint. In SN 35.247, it is shown how sense restraint eventually brings the six senses to a calm state where they no longer vigorously pull towards and away from agreeable and disagreeable things, and that relief from the prior volatility of one’s own senses is where the pleasure of _samādhi_ is born of. Even though there is a bodily component, it’s a side effect and not the source of the wholesome mental state. The previous Sutta, [SN 35.246](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246), has a similar description. See [this writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e2hztc/on_thinking_about_jh%C4%81na_by_ven_thanissaro/) for more on how jhāna is actually described in the Suttas. ",
  "sn35.97:2.7": "Ease (_sukha_) owing to the diminishing of pressure experienced by the mind, even though [the same things that used to agitate it are still there](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42). ",
  "sn35.97:2.18": "Since _samādhi_ is an abiding in a broader perspective—a state of being *separated* from things as the first jhāna description goes—one gets to see the more general aspects of one’s experience that were usually overlooked and thus automatically regarded as “me” or “mine” due to one’s engagement with particulars. The eye gets automatically imbued with the significance of being “me” when one is overly focused on particular sights. This is how one gets to discern the five aggregates [as far as they extend](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246#sn35.246:4.24), which is the complete opposite direction of becoming absorbed and looking even closer at particular instances of form, feeling, perception, etc. "
