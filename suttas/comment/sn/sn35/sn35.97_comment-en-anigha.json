  "sn35.97:0.3": "This Sutta clearly highlights how _samādhi_ is not a state of concentration or absorption, but the result of sense restraint. In SN 35.247, it is shown how sense restraint eventually brings the six senses to a calm state where they no longer vigorously pull towards and away from agreeable and disagreeable things, and that relief from the prior volatility of one’s own senses is where the pleasure of _samādhi_ is born of. Even though there is a bodily component, it’s a side effect and not the source of the wholesome mental state. The previous Sutta, [SN 35.246](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246), has a similar description. ",
  "sn35.97:2.7": "Comfort (_sukha_) owing to the diminishing of pressure experienced by the mind, even though [the same things that used to agitate it are still there](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42). "
