  "sn22.81:5.4": "See the comments in [AN 1.51-52](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an1.51-60#an1.51:1.0-an1.52:1.4). The fact that the regarding is an “activity” (_saṅkhāra_) does not imply that giving it up is a simple act of will. That _saṅkhāra_ is there precisely because one by and large does not understand _saṅkhāras_ as they are, hence _saṅkhāras_ are dependent on the simultaneous presence of _avijjā_ in _paṭiccasamuppāda_. It is therefore [only with the destruction of _avijjā_ that saṅkhāras cease](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-nature-of-ignorance/)—*immediately*. Whenever a separate volitional act of giving up is needed for a _saṅkhāra_ to stop, that _saṅkhāra_ is necessarily a secondary symptom of appropriation, not the appropriation itself. Moreover, _saṅkhāras_ are not revealed as a result of a direct attempt to recognize them; they become evident in the course of the Gradual Training. The ability to pick up the [“sign of the mind”](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.68) is the same as the ability to recognize these fundamental _saṅkhāras_. ",
  "sn22.81:5.8": "On the topic of dependent origination, see [MN 38](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38) and [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67). It's self-evident that a temporal process or sequence of arising is not what's being discussed here, in which case it wouldn't be possible to understand all these phenomena as dependently originated *after* they have arisen. AN 10.62: “No first point of craving for being can be discerned, before which it was not, and afterwards it came to be.” ",
  "sn22.81:5.12": "And for one who *doesn’t* know and see in this way, the influxes remain intact, no matter in what elaborate ways they manipulate the arisen form (feeling, perception, intention, or consciousness). The influxes are there precisely because of _not knowing_—concretely, of course, not just in theory—that there is nothing in the experience, not even craving, that can exist apart from the five aggregates. Whether that not-knowing manifests in the form of submitting to the pull of the craving, or trying to eliminate it altogether or [“manage”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndwMKAszWM) it is secondary; both fail to address the problem at its root, and the underlying assumption that the aggregates fundamentally _can_ be interfered with continues.",
  "sn22.81:10.8": "AN 10.93",
  "sn22.81:12.10": "In order to understand the nature of doubt (and any other hindrance) in this way and thereby cut it off at its root, one _must_ be ready to indefinitely [withstand the emotional pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XKSVuKe8_c) it will exert. If one cannot do that, it betrays the fact that one still tacitly regards the discomfort of the doubt, be it as acute as it may, as being somehow more than a [feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIx1EmVYbbc). This is why virtue, the practice of not acting out of unwholesome pressures, is the mandatory foundation for right understanding, even though it does not in itself give rise to such knowledge. See also [this passage](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn48#mn48:8.12-mn48:8.13) and its notes."
