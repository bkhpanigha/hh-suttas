  "sn55.5:3.3": "This statement highlights how the path *begins* with stream-entry. Prior to that, one’s effort must be aimed at  understanding what the path is, not to practicing it, just as the goal for someone who is new to weightlifting should be to learn the right technique, not to lift heavy weight. The same applies for all the other wholesome factors the Buddha described: the seven awakening factors are *attained* by the stream-enterer (47.30), the five faculties are present only in a _saddhānusāri_ at least (SN 48.12), who is [already a noble one by definition](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn34#mn34:10.1-mn34:10.2), and the four right strivings are only possible if one has properly understood the root of the wholesome and the root of the unwholesome, [which is the defining quality of a _sotāpanna_](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9#mn9:8.1-mn9:8.2).
