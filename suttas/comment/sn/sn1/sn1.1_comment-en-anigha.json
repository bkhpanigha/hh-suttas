  "sn1.1:0.3": "The following describes the Middle Way, which lies not in “moderation”, but in transcending both possible extremes in one’s attitude of relating to phenomena: nurturing delight in them on the one hand, and trying to abolish them or replace them on the other. Both attitudes involve a mistaken sense of ownership, and the right effort the Buddha taught is the cultivation of “neither standing nor striving”, as explained in [MN 134](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134). In other words, the right “effortlessness” that does not drift into negligence requires diligence (and the foundation of unwavering virtue remains unchanged from beginning to end). It does not come naturally or intuitively, since it goes completely against the grain of the untrained mind."
