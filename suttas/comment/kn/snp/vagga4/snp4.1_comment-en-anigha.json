  "snp4.1:0.2": "For this sutta I thought to translate kāma as ‘attraction(s)’. I don’t think this would necessarily work everywhere, but it has a few advantages: <br><br>1) It has the double sense of the object of desire and the desire itself, like the word kāma does -<br><br>2) It avoids the problem of ‘sensual pleasure’ which can easily get understood as only referring to specific coarse objects of bodily pleasure, especially sexuality, whereas kāma is much broader than that (cattle, lands, family); but at the same time avoids the problem of a more general word like ‘pleasure’ which can end up leading to trying to run away from anything and everything that happens to be agreeable.<br><br>It also fits the definition quite well of ‘_Cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā kāmūpasaṁhitā rajanīyā_, etc’., (‘Forms cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing’).<br><br>Moreover, there’s a subtle implication of possible danger or entrapment in the word ‘attraction’ (especially as a noun).

  "snp4.1:3.1": "<em>Anīgha:</em> As stated in [AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.2-an9.42:3.9), we are “confined” within things that can arouse desire, so it’s not about trying—[in vain](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn25)—to hide from everything agreeable so as to avoid the snake’s head. It’s about seeing that the trap lies in the passionate intention that would arise towards agreeable things—which are in themselves not the “attraction” as said in AN 6.63.

  "snp4.1:5.4": "<em>Anīgha:</em> Delight in and acquisition of pleasures is the opening through which suffering flows in. No matter how much effort and clever strategies are employed to remove it, there will be water in the boat for as long as this is not abandoned. "
