  "thag2.36:1.3": "[AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.2-an9.42:4.2). There is a stark difference between this and the general expectation of what the goal of the practice is. What’s being described here is that the right dispassion is not concerned with altering one’s subjective experience of an object—which requires time, while the Dhamma is timeless (_akālika_)—, but with detachment [_towards the subjective experience_](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=thag1.21). This is much more profound and hard to see and develop, while on the other hand there’s an endless array of mundane methods, such as psychotherapy, to modify one’s subjective experience of things and thereby *decrease*, not *uproot*, suffering.
