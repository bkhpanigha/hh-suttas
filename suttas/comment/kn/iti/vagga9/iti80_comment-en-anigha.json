  "iti80:2.3": "The Pāli for the third item is _parānuddayatā_, which I translate as “sympathy” to avoid confusion with _karuṇa_, the second _brahmavihāra_.<br><br>This distinction highlights how the latter is not about being concerned about the welfare of others or sharing their joys and sorrows—which is called a form of bondage in the verse just below—but simply about abandoning all underlying tendencies to annoyance and cruelty (AN 6.13), in the same way as _mettā_ [is simply about fully uprooting any liability to ill will](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn55#mn55:7.5-mn55:7.7).
