  "an9.42:4.2": "This contradicts the view that in the first jhāna one becomes unaware of the domain of the five senses and is *therefore* said to be “separated from sensuality”. Furthermore, the statement is not just that one is confined within the perception of objects of the five senses and that these simply become devoid of their agreeability. No, one is confined within *things that are desirable*. A thing is desirable because of how one’s own senses are disposed towards it, not because it belongs to some imaginary public set of things that are deemed as such. And that desirability is not in one's control, but it's also not in itself sensuality, as stated in AN 6.63. One must therefore train one's mind [to become disenchanted with the very wanting of the senses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttVxzlzlj0). That is the “opening amid confinement”, in contrast to directly trying to force the senses to not find things agreeable—an endless and ultimately misguided endeavor. "
