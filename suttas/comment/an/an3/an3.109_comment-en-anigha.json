  "an3.109:1.2": "One’s behavior is purified not by aligning it with an external standard, but by remaining watchful of [the intention behind it](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/). Intention is the most fundamental manifestation of the _citta_, whose root is the same as _cetanā_ (“intention”). <br><br> The most kind and compassionate external behaviors can [come out of various unwholesome intentions internally](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn21#mn21:10.1-mn21:10.6), while outwardly harsh forms of expression are not necessarily a sign of internal ill-will, as exemplified by the Buddha himself throughout the Suttas.
