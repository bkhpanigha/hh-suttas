  "an3.121:3.7": "Note how purity is not defined as the simple absence of these things (which can happen out of circumstance or accident). The principle behind this counterintuitive situation is that when these states have been fully understood (i.e., _avijjā_ is destroyed), they cannot be called “hindrances” anymore. They are hindrances when there is craving, and without ignorance craving cannot exist, even amidst the things that used to provoke it. To use an analogy, if someone has the key for the cell door and knows for a fact that they can get out at will, can that really be called imprisonment? The Dhamma applies to and must be realized solely within oneself, which in turn means that one is either hindered by these things because there is craving and ignorance in one’s own mind, or one isn’t. Thus it would be wrong to say “the hindrances are not _actually_ hindrances” as if it were a universal truth independent of one’s point of view. "
