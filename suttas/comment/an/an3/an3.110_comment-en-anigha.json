  "an3.110:1.2": "Here “mind” is _citta_, while “mental action” is _mano-kamma_. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BafurjP_lJY) for a discussion that practically illustrates the distinction between _citta_ and _mano_. <br><br> What this means is that it's not the external properties of an act (even an act of thinking or _mano_)  that determine its righteousness, but the state of mind (_citta_) that underlies it at that very moment. Therefore, acts that the whole world may regard as good and praiseworthy are, in light of the Dhamma, mistaken (_akusala_) if they are motivated by a defiled state of mind, while acts that the whole world may find reprehensible are righteous (_kusala_) if they are motivated by non-greed, non-aversion, and non-muddledness (e.g., [ going forth and leaving behind one’s family](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=ud1.8)). <br><br> See also the essay [“Intentions behind one’s actions”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/).
