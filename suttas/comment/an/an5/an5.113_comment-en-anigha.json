  "an5.113:1.3": "Meaning, he cannot prevent his mind from harboring lust or aversion when faced by sense objects that would provoke such states. This is why being proficient in [sense restraint](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/restraining-the-senses/) is a prerequisite for right meditation ([SN 46.6](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn46.6)). Otherwise, a personâ€™s meditation will revolve around finding ways to suppress the sense objects that the mind is too feeble to put up with without losing its center, giving rise to a wrong kind of peace.<br><br>See also [AN 5.139](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an5.139), which expands on this Sutta."
