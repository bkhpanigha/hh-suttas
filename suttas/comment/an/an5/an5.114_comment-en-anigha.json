  "an5.114:0.3": "Note the absence of any “meditation instructions” in the modern sense here. In SN 47.3, SN 47.15, and SN 47.16, the Buddha instructs to practice _satipaṭṭhāna_ only once the two foundations of all wholesome states are established: well-purified virtue, and right view. And all throughout the Suttas, the purification of mind invariably takes place *after* the purification of virtue. Concrete advice on achieving the former is given only to those who have fulfilled the prerequisite of the latter. ",
