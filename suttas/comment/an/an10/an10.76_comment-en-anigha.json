  "an10.76:4.3": "[MN 2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2) describes how the first three fetters are abandoned; _yoniso manasikāra_ is indeed the essential factor. The expression _cetaso līnattaṃ_ has usually been rendered as “mental sluggishness”, but _līna_ is used in the sense of being drawn back, concealed, apprehensive, timid, or overly passive. “Timidity of mind” is therefore more accurate, pointing to how a tendency to shy away from acknowledging the unpleasant truths of existence, as well as from the challenging task of taming deeply rooted unwholesome habits to the degree they are present, would bar one from attaining stream-entry.

  "an10.76:5.3": "In MN 138, scatteredness of mind is defined in terms of the presence of passion in regard to things that are perceived (*“when he sees a sight with the eye …”*). In other words, concentrating upon one single object so as to not perceive all others is not how one achieves a mind that is not scattered. As to awareness (_sampajaññā_), what’s being referred to is not a close observation of physical sensations or a “pure present moment awareness”, but a recognition of the states of mind that are directing one’s actions in one’s daily life. This is how _sampajaññā_ is defined in the Suttas (AN 8.9). See [“Intentions Behind One’s Actions](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/). ",
