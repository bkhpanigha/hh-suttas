  "an10.93:0.3": "The Right View stands out from all others in that it is the understanding of the nature of *all* views (including itself, by virtue of being the understanding of the five aggregates). That said, there is a wide gap between being able to describe the Buddhist view on theoretical grounds, similar to Anāthapiṇḍika here, and having widened the scope of that understanding so that it’s not simply a new standpoint that replaces the previous ones. That is why the wanderers’ accusation that Anāthapiṇḍika clings to his view of dependent origination would be perfectly valid if he had not, as he replied, understood the escape beyond even that view while still holding it—that is, if he were not a stream-enterer. Hence, both [_yoniso manasikāra_](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf) *and* the utterance of another are [indispensable for attaining the Right View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yptLIdi1JW8), as stated in [MN 43](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn43#mn43:13.1-mn43:13.4).

  "an10.93:6.2": "“_idameva saccaṃ moghamaññaṃ_” is traditionally interpreted as “Only this is true; everything else is wrong”, and it's thought that the statement is improper because claiming that there is only one truth is inherently bad, conceited, and lacking in epistemological humility. But we see in MN 136: “_moghaṃ kāyakammaṃ moghaṃ vacīkammaṃ, manokammameva saccanti_”, and this doesn’t mean that bodily and verbal actions are “false”, but that they are of little importance compared to mental action. It makes much more sense to interpret _idameva saccaṃ..._ in the same way, since all throughout the Suttas we find the Buddha [claiming that only his teaching is right](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn11#mn11:2.1-mn11:2.3), and that there is only one way to complete freedom from suffering.
