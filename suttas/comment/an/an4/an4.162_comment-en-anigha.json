  "an4.162:0.3": "This Sutta debunks the notion that whether one’s practice is pleasant or unpleasant is a matter of choice. It is a matter of the degree of defilements one carries. In the [very next Sutta](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an4.163), the pleasant practice is defined as the jhānas. What emerges from this, and from various other discourses—[AN 6.73](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73) and [AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=AN9.42) being prominent among them—is that the jhānas only come into the picture after a significant amount of work of freeing the mind from defilements—a task that, as shown by instances like [MN 14](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14) and [AN 3.94](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.94), is not completed by virtue of even stream-entry (it is in fact the _sakādāgami_ for whom the three defilements have inherently lessened). It also shouldn’t be hard to see that, at least compared to ancient times, our starting point today is by and large farther behind, especially considering how hard it usually is to come to terms with even the _thought_ of strictly observing the precepts and celibacy. The momentum carrying us in the opposite direction is generally much greater. ",
  "an4.162:2.6": "These five faculties are only present in the eight noble individuals (who are all irreversibly bound for enlightenment) as stated in SN 48.12. In other words, the entire discourse only really applies to noble ones, and even they cannot simply choose the pleasant practice. "
