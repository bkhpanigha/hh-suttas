  "an11.9:7.1": "With each item here the locative case occurs, which denotes simultaneity. This is the same reasoning behind my rendering of [the _satipaṭṭhāna_ stanza](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:3.1-mn10:3.5). The meaning of this section is not that all cognizable things disappear altogether, which would be illogical to present as the only right meditation. What this passage means is that the mind is not “established” in any of these things while they are there (described also at MN 138 as “scattered and diffused consciousness”), and this is already the case in the first jhāna. For a detailed treatise on what this entails, see [“The Meaning of Yoniso Manasikāra”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf). ",
  "an11.9:7.3": "At AN 4.77, the field of one in jhāna (_jhāyissa jhānavisayo_) is said to be impossible to ascertain. This is because _jhāna_ does not take place at the level of the _content_ of one's experience, not even, as stated here, the objects of the mental faculty (_mano_). Simply put, jhāna is the unification of the mind (_citta_) on a certain overarching attitude, purified from unwholesome inclinations, that is independent of the content of the six senses; the only constraint being that in the first jhāna there cannot be speech, in the second there can be no thinking and pondering, and so on (SN 36.11).
