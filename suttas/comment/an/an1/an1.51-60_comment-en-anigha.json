  "an1.51:1.3": "The fundamental defilement is ignorance. Simply by not rightly understanding for himself, as it is, that no experience can ever be something other or “more” than form, feeling, perception, intention, and consciousness, both for _puthujjana_ and _Arahant_ alike, the former is subject to defilements. The defilements are “adventitious” because ultimately they too cannot be something _apart_ from form, feeling, perception, intention, and consciousness,  but because that is not understood by the _puthujjana_, the defilements are there. (This is the meaning of the famous utterance of the Bāhiya Sutta, “In the seen, just the seen”, which does not refer to to some sort of “bare awareness” where parts of the aggregates have been cut off—an expectation that plainly indicates the presence of the very ignorance in question). When this is understood, there is no room whatsoever for passion, aversion, or muddledness of any kind (let alone the actions and misconduct that would result from them). [“Why Are You Not an Arahant Yet?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xcPXgsuIsU). ",
  "an1.51:1.4": "They do not understand how to _abandon_ the aggregates as they are. Instead, they inevitably (and unwittingly) seek to manipulate them one way or another, and since ignorance underlies that entire endeavor, purity does not lie at the end of it. "
