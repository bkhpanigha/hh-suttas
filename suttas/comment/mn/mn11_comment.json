The view of non-being  would always lie beneath an ordinary person's conception of _anattā_, as they could not see how being (_bhava_) can be brought to an end without somehow doing away with the *things* that are taken as self, i.e., one or another aspect of the five aggregates. An example would be the tacit view that an Arahant no longer experiences mental feelings, but at most only physical sensations. ",
