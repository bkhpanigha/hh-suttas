  "mn57:8.2": "_sabyābajjha_, lit. with-affliction. The term carries connotations not only of harm but also of illness, and such harm applies to oneself as well, not only to others. So, even though the practices of the two ascetics here are in a sense harmless to others, the single most unbeneficial quality is wrong view, as explained in the Suttas. ",
  "mn57:8.6": "This line has been translated as “This is how a being arises from a being”, but this doesn’t make sense. The Suttas don’t portray a being in the next life as different from that of the previous life, unlike the celebrated simile of the candle that is of later origin, or the views of “constant flux” claiming that there is no continuity even from one moment to the next. _bhūta_ simply means “that which is”, which in some contexts can mean “living being” as in individual, but not here. ",
  "mn57:9.2": "_abyābajjha_, non-afflictive. "
