Rather, as stated here, wherever there is ignorance and craving, which is always, _bhava_ is there, at least of the third kind in the best case scenario. Sensual being is perpetually present for someone who is not free from sensuality, even at times when they are not fantasizing about sensual pleasures. _bhava_ refers to one's all-encompassing mode of existing, not to specific choices that are made within that and can straightforwardly be abstained from.

This is not the same as _manosaṅkhārā_, the activities pertaining to the sixth sense, which indeed cannot stop altogether except for one who dies. Furthermore, if these were to _completely_ cease in the cessation-of-perception-and-feeling, the latter would not be able to be accompanied with any understanding, whereas in reality it is the only attainment of _samādhi_ that is guaranteed to lead to Arahantship.
