  "mn8:1.1": "On the basic level, this Sutta is about being willing to do what one knows is in line with the Dhamma even if the whole world does the opposite. There's a lot more to it than just that, however, which can be inferred by the Buddha’s injunction at the end, which he would give only in the context of a very profound teaching. The more fundamental message of the Sutta is about learning to see one’s own mind (_citta_) as another person (compared to a wild untamed elephant in MN 125), and recognizing that no matter what bad habits and tendencies try to re-assert themselves or what mental states come up, nothing is stopping one from adopting a right attitude despite them (which is how one purifies the mind, instead of trying to control it directly). As the last part says, one can only tame another if one is tamed oneself. Namely, one can only tame one’s mind and make it imperturbable if one is oneself not falling prey to its moods, whether through welcoming or through resistance. That is how, counterintuitively in a sense, the mind would cease to exert control over one, and defilements would be ‘worn away’ correctly. See [SN 1.1](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn1.1), and [“Becoming Imperturbable”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-039SYi2a94) ",
  "mn8:3.3": " _ādi_ means “start” or “beginning”. ",
  "mn8:3.6": "One cannot simply take up a new view, even an on-paper “right” view taught by the Buddha in favor of an old one. The genuine Right View is gained by understanding the nature of *all* views. "
