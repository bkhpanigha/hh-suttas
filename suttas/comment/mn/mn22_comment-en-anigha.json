  "mn22:9.1": "There are certain acts, chiefly sexual intercourse, consumption of recreational drugs, consumption of entertainment, accumulation of possessions for the sake of sensual enjoyment, etc., which cannot be performed without there being a mental state of delight, which is the root of suffering (SN 35.64). Those are the actions an Arahant is incapable of engaging in (AN 9.7) Believing that there is no harm in such actions is believing that there is no harm in suffering; it is for that reason alone that the Buddha calls it a “pernicious view”. As it happens, the view that detachment and equanimity can co-exist with the pursuit of sensual pleasures—often only for laypeople, conveniently enough—is not hard to come across in contemporary Buddhist teachings, including Theravada. ",
  "mn22:37.5": " The view that the self gets annihilated does not need to be deliberately held. It is enough to try to deny one’s experience of a sense of self instead of undermining it through the discernment of _paṭiccasamuppāda_ (see [MN 10](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10). Most often, a view much the same in its nature as the third standpoint referred to in SN 12.18 is what is confounded with _anattā_. This is why, without the insight of impermanence and  __paṭiccasamuppāda_ of a noble disciple, there is no alternative but to either accept or deny the self, both of which are mistaken (SN 12.15). "
