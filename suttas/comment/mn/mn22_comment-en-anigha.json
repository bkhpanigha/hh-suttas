  "mn22:9.1": "There are certain acts, chiefly sexual intercourse, consumption of recreational drugs, indulgence in entertainment, accumulation of possessions for the sake of sensual enjoyment, etc., which cannot be performed without there being a mental state of delight, which is the root of suffering (SN 35.64). Those are the [actions an Arahant is incapable of engaging in](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.7). <br><br>Believing that there is no harm in such actions is believing that there is no harm in suffering, thus it’s called a “pernicious view”. <br>As it happens, the view that the pursuit of sensual pleasures isn’t an obstruction to awakening is not difficult to encounter in modern Buddhist discourse. ",
  "mn22:27.1": "The true difficulty lies in concretely recognizing the full extent of the aggregates, not in the contemplation of _anattā_. This is why members of others sects who had already developed a high degree of _sīla_ and _samādhi_—un-absorption of the mind that uncovers the extent of one’s whole experience previously obscured by desire and passion—were able to gain the Right View and beyond quite easily. ",
  "mn22:37.5": "The view that the self gets annihilated does not need to be deliberately held, simply trying to deny one’s experience of a sense of self—instead of undermining it through the discernment of _paṭiccasamuppāda_ (see [MN 10](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10))—is enough to fall into this category. Most often, a view much the same in its nature as the third standpoint referred to in SN 12.18 is what is confounded with _anattā_. This is why, without the insight of impermanence and _paṭiccasamuppāda_ of a noble disciple, there is no alternative but to either accept or deny the self, both of which are mistaken (SN 12.15). "
