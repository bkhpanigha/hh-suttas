It's actually a natural tendency for the ignorant mind to seek relief by [not acknowledging the full weight of the situations it finds itself in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32K94HGsDHQ), and it is not uncommon to approach the Dhamma with that same attitude.

  "mn4:22-26.2": "“Ease” more closely matches _sukha_ than “pleasure” does. In fact, the word “pleasure” would correspond in most contexts to _kāma_, but since in English it would read strangely in a few cases, I've chosen “sensuality”. ",
