  "mn25:12.2": "The first jhāna is the escape “amidst confinement”, defined in AN 9.42 as the five strands of sensuality. The moral of the simile is that the fourth group of ascetics, like the four herd of deer, manage to develop dispassion for sensuality without having to actually leave the domain of the senses, the “feeding ground”. Practicing “absorption” meditation is tantamount to shunning the entire feeding ground, like the second herd of deer, instead of learning to circumvent just Māra's traps. ",
  "mn25:12.3": "Māra cannot see one in the first jhāna because the mind is not established upon any specific object. The entire six sense base [belongs to Māra](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.19/en/sujato), so one cannot escape simply by concentrating on certain objects within that. See AN 11.9. "
