  "mn6:3.1": "  _Jhāna_ means “contemplation; reflection”, never “absorption” or anything along those lines. The word “meditation”, which derives from the Latin _meditari_, would in its original usage have been a good translation for _jhāna_. But the term has in modern times taken on a significance that is alien to the teachings found in the Suttas, and so I have chosen to leave it untranslated. The other somewhat accurate alternatives “contemplation, reflection” or similar may be misinterpreted as denoting simply abstract thinking and philosophizing. _Jhāna_ is the middle way between the one extreme popular today of absorbing oneself in the “present moment” , and the other extreme of abstract meandering divorced from one’s concrete present situation. Thus, _jhāna_ can be said to be about “concrete reflection”, and this would apply for all the _jhānas_ and even formless attainments, as evidenced by “reflection”(_paccavekkhanā_) in MN 106 being that which leads to every single successive stage of _samādhi_. See [this essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/what-the-jhanas-actually-are/) for more on the subject of _jhāna_ and the fallacies in the contemporary understanding of it. ",
  "mn6:4.1": " _ajjhattaṃ cetosamatha_ > internal appeasement/peace of mind: The root √sam simply denotes “peace; calm”. “Stillness” can at times accompany peace, but they are by no means the same (AN 3.63), and motionlessness, whether of body or of mind, can well be underlain by defilements, and delusion chiefly. From the very beginning of true _samatha_, the mind would be able to remain at peace internally even when there is activity and movement as long as it's not of an unwholesome kind. That is why it's instrumental in the task of overcoming suffering permanently, as opposed to just providing a safe corner to hide from it temporarily. ",
