    "mn21:20.1": "It's not that an Arahant would experience no mental displeasure as a result of this experience. Mental displeasure is _dukkhavedanā_, and the aggregate of feeling (which should never be confused with “sensation”) still remains in an Arahant. So this is not only saying that one should be unmoved by the physical pain alone, but by the mental one too (AN 6.55, [SN 35.228](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.228)). If anything, it is the mental displeasure that causes an ignorant mind to become corrupted with aversion. When people encounter severe physical pain while in state of euphoria, it does not arouse aversion in them. On the other hand, even minor pains can cause a person in a bad mood to lash out in anger.
