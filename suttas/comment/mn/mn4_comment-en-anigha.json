  "mn4:2.9": "AN 9.3. ",
  "mn4:21.1": "This statement can be broadened beyond this specific context. It's actually a natural tendency for the ignorant mind to seek relief by [not acknowledging the full weight of the situations it finds itself in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32K94HGsDHQ), and it is not uncommon to approach the Dhamma with that same attitude. ",
  "mn4:22-26.2": "“Comfort” more closely matches _sukha_ than “pleasure” does. In fact, the word “pleasure” would correspond in most contexts to _kāma_, but since in English it would read strangely in a few cases, I've chosen “sensuality”. ",
  "mn4:29.1": "“Reappearance” is a much more accurate here than “rebirth”, an expression which in fact does not exist in Pāli. "
