  "mn29:2.5": "In this and all of the following instances in this discourse (as well as the next), it's not that the person would be in full awareness deciding they don't want to progress any further on the path. What's taking place here is an attitude of ”bad faith” or [“inauthenticity”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32K94HGsDHQ)—a deeply rooted, not entirely deliberate refusal to acknowledge the truth of one's situation, more specifically the fact that while one might be upholding the ideals, behavior, and even practices of one who is striving for liberation, internally one still chooses to not do one's best in abandoning *all* forms of passion, aversion, and muddledness, and also not feeling a sense of compunction that would at least pull one out of that attitude eventually. See [MN 5](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%205). ",
  "mn29:5.42": "“Knowledge-and-vision” (_ñāṇadassana_) refers, in colloquial terms, to “insights”. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the attainment of a groundbreaking insight that makes one a stream-enterer, even if it’s accurate, and thinking that it is leads to taking for granted significant traces of wrong view that still remain. As said in [MN 1](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1#mn1:26.1-mn1:26.4), even a genuine insight or apprehension of Nibbāna—which is not a mystical state or experience, but simply the absence of passion—lies within a _puthujjana’s_ reach. <br><br> A stream-enterer or higher does have the criterion to discern what true freedom from suffering (“the heartwood”) is like, and therefore they could not mistakenly settle for something that falls short of it. They would at best be procrastinating the work they know they have left, for up to 7 lives at most. ",
