These are not blatant, deliberate standpoints, but rather the two attitudes that anyone who doesn't see the Middle Way (_paṭiccasamuppāda_) will inevitably harbor to some degree. They are held precisely to the extent that they are not noticed.  <br><br>The view of non-being underlies a _puthujjana’s_ notion of _anattā_, as they cannot not yet see how being (_bhava_) can cease without somehow doing away with the *things* that are taken as self, i.e., one or another aspect of the five aggregates that they conflate with the attitude of ownership itself. <br><br> As stated in MN 119, _upādāna_ is *not* the five aggregates. To the extent one doesn’t see this as it is, one’s conception of Nibbāna will be infected with the view of non-being. ",
