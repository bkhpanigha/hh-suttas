  "mn29:5.42": "“knowledge-and-vision” (_ñāṇadassana_) in this context cannot be referring to noble understanding. The discourse, as indicated in the beginning, was given in relation to Devadatta, who managed to achieve even supernatural powers while remaining an ordinary person, and DN 1 describes how some ascetics could recollect their past lives. A stream-enterer or higher does have the criterion to discern what true freedom from suffering (“the heartwood”) is like, and therefore they could not mistakenly settle for something that falls short of it. They would at best be procrastinating the work they know they have left, for up to 7 lives at most. See also the next comment. ",

  "mn29:6.17": "_asamayavimutti_, lit. “liberation not (of one) occasion”. If the knowledge-and-vision described above referred to the Noble Truths, meaning it lead to _sotāpatti_ or higher, it would also be irreversible. "
