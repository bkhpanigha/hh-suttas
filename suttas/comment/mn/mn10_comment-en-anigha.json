  "mn10:1.6": "On _ekāyana magga_ see [this comment to MN 12](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn12#mn12:37.5)",
  "mn10:2.1": " The [“noble method”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhIkN4C15Pk) is seeing _paṭiccasamuppāda_ with _yoniso manasikāra_ (SN 12.41, [MN 2](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%202), [“The Meaning of Yoniso Manasikāra”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf)).  _sati_ literally means “memory” or “recollection”, from _√sar_ (“remember”), whereas “mindfulness”, owing to the prevalence of mainstream interpretations, often carries connotations of “focused awareness” that are foreign to the term _sati_. [MN 53](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53) defines a noble disciple endowed with supreme _sati_ as “one who remembers what was said and done long ago”, and even in everyday life, it’s evident that remembering is *not* a matter of unbroken attention; otherwise, we would forget everything we don't focus on continuously, and we wouldn’t be able to keep an overarching goal in mind while switching between various subtasks. <br><br>It is this same quality of remembering, just applied aspects of one’s present experience that are relevant to freedom from suffering, that underlies each of the four _satipaṭṭhānas_. Not incidentally, the Right View is necessary for the Right Recollection: it’s impossible to recollect something that isn’t already known. <br><br>[“Focus”, “observation”, “watching” or “bare attention”,](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an11.9#an11.9:2.3-an11.9:2.17) on the other hand, require one to forget (ignore or overlook) the general aspects of one’s present situation—where ignorance, defilements, hindrances, and wrong views lie—in favor of particularities, and thus the domain where *both* calm and insight are to be developed is obscured. ",
  "mn10:3.2": "[“Seeing a Body Within The Body”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/), [“Putting The Body First”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB9dQFtXMKs). The locative case (_kāye_) conveys the sense of “within” as well as simultaneity, hence I’ve chosen “concurrently with the body”. _anupassī_ is a verbal adjective indicating an ongoing action, in this case of “seeing along with”, hence “maintaining perspective”. ",
  "mn10:4.0.2": "See [“How to Calm Your Mind”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg) and [“Mindfulness of Breathing and Calming of Aversion”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrgV9KI5LeI), available in written form in [Dhamma Within Reach](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/dwr/) and [The Only Way to Jhāna](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/new-book-jhana/) respectively. ",
  "mn10:4.2": "_parimukhaṃ_ > “at the fore”: This does not mean attending to the sensations of breathing at one’s nostrils, or anything of that nature. The same expression occurs for example in [MN 39](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39#mn39:13.1) and several other passages unrelated to _ānāpānasati_ that are about overcoming the five hindrances by reflecting on their troublesome nature.  _“parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā”_ simply means, both in those passages and here, that one makes the establishment of the perspective the priority. ",
  "mn10:4.3": " Literally: “with memory, he breathes in; with memory, he breathes out”. _sati_ here, as always, pertains to something that is *not* the particular in and out breaths. That is the principle behind all memory: having in mind, in regard to what is directly present, something that is *not* directly present. The subject of this memory is not the breathing itself, just as a memory about a cup that’s in one’s hand is not *in* the perception of the cup itself. ",
  "mn10:4.4": " Through this, one becomes familiar with how it’s ultimately the body that is responsible for breathing, as one does not get to decide whether the right type of breath at the moment is long or short. This reveals how the nature of breathing constitutes the true foundation for one’s experience, and not one's sense of control and preference. One can try to manipulate it and influence it, but it is apparent if one is honest that this is always secondary to the body, which holds the final say. This would eventually undercut one’s appropriation of the body if discerned to the sufficient extent, making one’s sense of control (and thus sense of self) be seen as circumstantial—meaning, there is a factual capacity for control, but since it’s subordinate and uncertain, it falls short of justifying any form of ownership and delight. [“Breathing Towards Death”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/breathing-towards-death/) and [Notes on Meditation](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/notes-on-meditation/). ",
  "mn10:4.6": "This doesn't mean expanding one's awareness to include more bodily sensations, as this instruction is sometimes interpreted. Such an exercise is irrelevant to the task of understanding the unconditional cessation of suffering. [MN 44](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn44#mn44:15.2) defines the _kāyasaṅkhāra_ as in and out breathing because “those phenomena are tied to the body”, and thus they serve to outline the entirety of what the body is. The entire six-sense-base, which is where any and all assumptions of ownership would find footing, is seen within the context of the act of breathing, as dependent upon it. This does not involve concentration upon the breath, but the exact opposite: while the six senses are directly experienced, whether while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, the act of breathing—seen to be in one’s control only relatively speaking—is known as the sustenance that they depend on. ",
  "mn10:5.2": " Only when the foundation that (one’s experience of) the body stands upon is recognized does it become clear how the body is impermanent—how one is privy to neither its arising/increasing nor is falling apart, because it is its foundation (evident from the start to be outside one’s control, such as the functioning of the lungs) which determines that. Observing instances of arising and ceasing in trivial sense objects, with no recognition of simultaneous dependence (_paṭiccasamuppāda_), leaves one’s ownership of that same observation unaffected. This is [“perceiving not-self with self”](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2#mn2:8.5) due to _ayoniso manasikāra_. ",
  "mn10:5.3": "[“Mindfulness of the Elements”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psApaFXI_QU) ",
  "mn10:6.1": "Awareness of the current posture can be made the perspective from which anything at all is experienced. All one may be thinking about, no matter if its content is entirely divorced from the present situation, can be discerned as subordinate to the fact that one is currently seated, for instance. Sustaining that simple memory correctly, i.e., with _yoniso manasikāra_, while various phenomena continue to manifest is more than enough to abide “disengaged, not taking up anything in the world”. On the other hand, intently focusing on one’s footsteps while walking, the sensations of the knees touching the floor while sitting, etc., are exercises that revolve around shrinking one’s perspective. ",
  "mn10:8.1": " One who has awareness (_sampajaññā_) is defined in SN 47.35 as one who knows feelings, perceptions, and thoughts as they arise, remain, and cease. But this awareness would always have to pertain to the general, fundamental level of one’s experience (e.g., the thoughts and attitudes behind the desire to engage in a sensation-watching exercise when it arises, rather than the specific sense objects that would be apprehended through said exercise). ",
  "mn10:10.1": " This isn’t meant to be a mechanical visualization of the body parts. For it to qualify as a development of perspective, the *relationship* between the (unattractive) organs and the body (that one takes as attractive by default) must be discerned, while the two are present, as opposed to trying to override one with the other. As with all the other contemplations, the two aspects are on different levels—one is a memory about the present experience (the image of body parts) and the other is the present experience itself—“this very body”, which also happens to be perceiving, feeling, and thinking. ",
  "mn10:10.2": "[“Beautiful Side of Ugly, Living Side of Death”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwxRFPkurhI). ",
  "mn10:12.1": "[A brief comment on the four elements.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn28#mn28:6.1) ",
  "mn10:32.0": "Feelings must not be confused with sensations. A feeling or _vedanā_ is the general pleasantess, unpleasantness, or neutrality of an experience, while sensations are perceptions (_saññā_, the third aggregate) of the fifth sense base (touch). Sensations/perceptions that would most of the time be felt unpleasantly can sometimes be felt as the opposite, depending on the situation where they arise. The lines further below that speak about “feelings not of the flesh (_nirāmisa_)” are the best proof of _vedanā_ not being sensations ",
  "mn10:32.6": "This corresponds to the pleasure of _jhāna_, which contrary to popular belief does not primarily originate from bodily sensations. It is born of the [mental relief of no longer being a victim to the five hindrances](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39#mn39:14.29-mn39:14.30), and that mental relief generates a bodily counterpart on its own. Making the mind calm by fabricating pleasure through somatic techniques is not that different from the mental release that comes from a massage, i.e., pleasure of the flesh. ",
  "mn10:33.4": " Each individual sense experience is necessarily accompanied by a feeling (SN 35.60), but on the whole, there is always one general feeling underpinning the whole of one’s situation. When that feeling is unpleasant, particular pleasures are not gratifying, and when it is pleasant, particular displeasures are not upsetting. By understanding that it is that general feeling (which is always “already there”) that determines one’s experience of the world, the never-ending project of trying to feel only pleasure and avoid displeasure is seen as futile, since even if the particular feelings can be manipulated by doing this or that, the general one changes of its own accord. [“Feeling Only One Feeling”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGtA6eKn8mE). ",
  "mn10:35.4": "_cittānupassanā_ is about not forgetting one’s present mental state. [Knowing a mind of passion as a mind of passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XMDbO8JLvo) would pull one away from the otherwise automatic engagement in the thoughts that mind inclines to, without having to go out of one’s way to think something else. If this perspective is sustained, the mind will be purified of passion at its root, since lack of perspective is what’s responsible for all unwholesome states. They cannot induce themselves. See the discussion in the comments of [MN 18](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn%2018#comment1). ",
  "mn10:36.2": "",
  "mn10:36.4": "The five hindrances are not to be found in the content of an arisen phenomenon. The hindrances are attitudes found “internally” in relation to any phenomena that arise, so replacing one phenomenon with another, e.g, a meditation object, won’t ultimately help. Recognizing the presence of hindrances correctly [is purity of mind](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.121) already, since the only way for the mind to be defiled by them is to overlook them. [“Seeing Through the Hindrances Instead of Denying Them”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDdMyOTylH0) ",
  "mn10:38.1": " The aggregates should be understood as the foundations of any experience, which, when put into perspective, undermine one’s assumed mastery of it. They are not things that one can observe and “grasp” by means of direct attention, as the result of that would just be a particular instance of the aggregate of perception. Similarly for the sense fields below. ",
  "mn10:40.1": "[“In the Seen, Just The Seen”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp0WtFO5qm0). ",
  "mn10:40.3": "The fetters of passion and aversion do not arise because of the eye, nor because of sights. This is why it’s possible, if one understands the sense fields, to fully ensure that fetters do not arise even if the things that used to trigger them happen to come into range. ",
