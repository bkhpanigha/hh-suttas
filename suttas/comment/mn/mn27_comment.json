  "mn27:15.2": "Sense restraint should not be confused with “sense deprivation”. The 6 senses will inevitably have to encounter agreeable and disagreeable objects, and the practice is to simply not allow one's attention to the pleasant objects to be motivated by longing, and the attention to the unpleasant objects by aversion. This is best illustrated with eating: agreeable flavors will be experienced, but one can make sure not to lose the context of [what the practical purpose of eating is](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2#mn2:14.2). The same applies when encountering any other sense object; whatever motivation lies behind attending to it, it should never be longing or aversion. If those are not present, there is no issue. But there is reason why in the Gradual Training sense restraint comes after virtue and precepts: it is impossible to commit the actions outlined in the section just above without states of longing and aversion being present.

  "mn27:15.7": "I translate _mano_ as “mind-sense” so as to not create confusion with _citta_, which is fundamentally a different thing. See for instance AN 6.55: the _mano_ of an Arahant can be assailed by oppressive phenomena, but their _citta_ would always remain unmoved. _mano_ is said to be Māra's property, while the _citta_ can be trained to no longer fall under his control (SN 35.246)."
