  "mn39:4.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Chiddavā</i> (“inconsistent”) is more literally “full of holes”. Its opposite (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>acchidda</i>) is one of the standard descriptors of “impeccable” precepts (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn48/en/sujato#6.12'>MN 48:6.12</a>). | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṁvuta</i> (past participle of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁvara</i>) can mean either “restrained” or “hidden, secretive”. The sense depends on the syntax; the two instances of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ca</i> split the listed items into three plus two, with the negative distributed over the last two items. This agrees with the commentary, which explains “secretive” as “concealing one’s faults”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṁvara</i> appears in the sense of sense restraint below (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn39/en/sujato#8.4'>MN 39:8.4</a>).
