  "mn34:10.2": "See the SN 25.1-10. The _dhammānusāri_ and _saddhānusāri_ are already noble individuals, said to have “arrived at the fixed course of rightness” and “transcended the plane of ordinary people”. Possessing the five faculties of a noble one (SN 48.12), they are destined for enlightenment in the same way as a stream-enterer, because they are guaranteed to become one before they die. This does not at all refer to the average practitioner, no matter how committed they are, and it would be a grave mistake for anyone to assume themselves to be at this stage. The caveat is although the statements summarizing the Buddha's teaching found throughout SN 25 are things that every faithful Buddhist would “agree” with, an ordinary person necessarily misconceives those statements in one way or another, and thus, technically, the teaching that they're avidly devoted to is *not* the Buddha's teaching even though they take it as such. Hence, they do not qualify as a faith-follower. "
