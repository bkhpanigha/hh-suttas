  "mn1:1.1": "",
  "mn1:2.1": "The“root” being described is not a metaphysical concept, but simply ignorance in its all-pervasiveness. The purpose of the discourse, and the reason for the extensive repetition, is to show that no experience that an ordinary person has will occur apart from the “root” of conceiving. ",
  "mn1:3.1": "The “true persons” are the noble individuals, who have understood and acquired the Noble Eightfold Path (SN 45.26, SN 55.5). ",
  "mn1:3.2": "[Perception is Already Ignorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZvqDJlxvx) ",
  "mn1:3.3": "“Perceiving”and “conceiving” here do not refer to layering concepts and notions over the “raw” experience. An experience of an “ultimate reality” that is supposedly free from concepts would be affected by the ordinary person’s conceiving just as much as any regular experience. The problem was never the content of experience, and so the solution cannot not lie there either. ",
  "mn1:3.5": "",
  "mn1:25.1": "i.e., anything and everything. The six internal sense bases coupled with their external counterparts constitute everything, or “the All” (SN 35.23). ",
  "mn1:26.2": "Even a so-called “glimpse of Nibbāna”would be contaminated by the very same conceiving. It would arise from the same “root”, as it is simply another perception whose *nature* is not understood, no matter how extraordinary, groundbreaking, or revelatory it appears to be. ",
  "mn1:27.1": "A “trainee” is a noble one who is not yet an Arahant (SN 48.53). “Comprehends”(_abhijānāti_) means that the noble disciple rightly knows the entire “scope” of any experience. While for an ordinary person, a tacit taking of some ill-defined part of the picture as their Self always lingers “the knower”, “the doer”, etc.—even if they fully “agree” with the doctrine of _anattā_ and deliberately refrain from labeling anything as “I” or “mine”. A trainee fully understands even that subtle “inner end” that a _puthujjana_ takes as their Self to be equally within the experience of earth, water, etc. If that which *could* be taken as self is, instead of denied, seen to fall squarely *within* the experience regardless of seeming privilege over it, then it is impossible to take it as an extra-spatial and extra-temporal master of the same experience. That assumed mastery is what the wrong view of self really boils down to, not to whether that which *can* be taken as the Self/master really exists or not. ",
  "mn1:27.2": "The trainee, due to his understanding, has the choice to dispel all conceiving. Persevering in that is how they would eventually become fully and irreversibly established in the Deathless. ",
  "mn1:75.4": "Passion = _rāga_. “Greed” is _lobha_, which is coarser and oriented more towards external things, whereas “lust” has sexual connotations. _Rāga_, on the other hand, is very general, including even the _arūparāga_ still present in a non-returner, who is by definition already free from greed and lust. ",
  "mn1:123.4": " “Muddledness” corresponds better to _moha_ than “delusion”, which tends to signify an incorrect belief regarding a specific state of affairs. “Delusion” in the context of Dhamma (meaning crudely wrong beliefs like eternalism) is more of a side effect of the lack of clarity (muddledness) regarding the nature of one’s experience, which is why simply being told the way things truly are and accepting the right views intellectually, thereby ceasing to be “deluded”, is not enough to remove _moha_. ",
  "mn1:147.4": "All Arahants fully understand their experience to the extent necessary to be completely free from suffering, but the Buddha understands the nature of things even beyond that point. "
