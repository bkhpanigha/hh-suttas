  "mn31:7.10": "It’s good to strive for harmony with one’s peers, but not at the cost of calling out wrong as wrong when necessary, even if wrongness is accompanied with good intentions. Furthermore, as said in [MN 48](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn48), it is the Right View that truly allows for harmony and success in a community. If the members of a commune don't possess Right View, then the harmony that is achieved will be superficial, and more often than not will come through covering up each individual’s personal responsibility and enforcing the undertaking of predefined habits and practices (_sīlabbataparāmāsa_). That’s not what’s being advocated here: in this case, since all three bhikkhus were Arahants, there would never be any fundamental fault with what what any of them was in favor of, and therefore there was no reasonable grounds for disagreement.
