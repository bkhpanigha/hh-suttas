  "mn7:21.3": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyesight can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "mn7:21.4": "I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. ",
  "mn7:21.5": "May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the ascetic Gotama’s presence?” ",
  "mn7:22.1": "And the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. ",
  "mn7:22.2": "Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, abiding alone, withdrawn, heedful, diligent, and resolute, lived having entered upon the supreme goal of the renunciate life for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience.
