  "mn53:2.1": "Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. ",

  "mn53:2.3": "“Venerable sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. ",
  "mn53:2.4": "May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it. ",
  "mn53:2.5": "That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.” ",
  "mn53:3.1": "The Buddha consented with silence. ",
  "mn53:3.2": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right.

  "mn53:3.3": "bowed, stood to one side, ",
  "mn53:3.4": "and told him of their preparations, saying, ",
  "mn53:3.5": "",
  "mn53:3.6": "“Venerable sir, please come at your convenience.” ",
  "mn53:4.1": "Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. ",
  "mn53:4.2": "The Saṅgha of bhikkhus also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. ",
  "mn53:4.3": "The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. ",
  "mn53:5.1": "The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda, ",
  "mn53:5.2": "“Ānanda, speak as it occurs to you about the practicing trainee to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. ",
  "mn53:5.3": "My back is sore, ",

  "mn53:5.5": "“Yes, venerable sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "mn53:5.6": "And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—recollected and aware, having set the intention to get up. ",
  "mn53:6.1": "Then Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan: ",
  "mn53:6.2": "“Mahānāma, there is the case where a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue, guards the sense doors, is moderate in eating, and is dedicated to vigilance. They have seven good qualities, and they get the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. ",
  "mn53:7.1": "And how is a noble disciple accomplished in virtue? ",
  "mn53:7.2": "It’s when a noble disciple is virtuous and lives restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper behavior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they train in the training rules. ",
  "mn53:7.3": "That’s how a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue. ",
  "mn53:8.1": "And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors? ",
  "mn53:8.2": "When they see a sight with the eye, they don’t grasp at signs and features of it ",
  "mn53:8.3": "on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on them. They practice to restrain that; they guard the eye faculty and bring about the restraint of the eye faculty. ",
  "mn53:8.4": "When they hear a sound with the ear … ",
  "mn53:8.5": "When they smell an odor with the nose … ",
  "mn53:8.6": "When they taste a flavor with the tongue … ",
  "mn53:8.7": "When they touch a touch with the body … ",
  "mn53:8.8": "When they cognize a phenomenon with the mental faculty, they don’t grasp at signs and features of it ",
  "mn53:8.9": "on account of which—due to abiding with the mental faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on them. They practice to restrain that; they guard the mental faculty and bring about the restraint of the mental faculty. ",

  "mn53:9.2": "It’s when a noble disciple eats with reflection in light of the origin: ",
  "mn53:9.3": "‘Not for entertainment, indulgence, beautification, or adornment, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support the renunciate life. In this way, I shall put an end to old feelings and not give rise to new feelings, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ ",

  "mn53:10.5": "Having gotten up in the last watch of the night, they continue to cleanse the mind of obstructive states while waking or sitting. ",
  "mn53:10.6": "That’s how a noble disciple is dedicated to vigilance. ",
  "mn53:11.1": "And how does a noble disciple have seven good qualities? ",
  "mn53:11.2": "It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ",
  "mn53:11.3": "‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",

  "mn53:13.1": "They have a sense of remorse. They are remorseful for bad conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and remorseful of acquiring any bad, unbeneficial qualities. ",
  "mn53:14.1": "They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the [right] meaning and phrasing, and which describe a renunciate life that’s entirely complete and pure—such teachings he has learned much of, remembered, rehearsed verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view. ",
  "mn53:15.1": "They live with effort roused up for giving up unbeneficial qualities and embracing beneficial qualities. They’re resilient, vigorous, and not slacking off when it comes to beneficial qualities. ",
  "mn53:16.1": "They’re recollected. They possess utmost recollection and judiciousness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. ",
  "mn53:17.1": "They’re wise. They have the wisdom related to arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. ",
  "mn53:17.2": "That’s how a noble disciple has seven good qualities. ",
  "mn53:18.1": "And how does a noble disciple get the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty? ",
  "mn53:18.2": "It’s when a noble disciple, quite disjoined from sensuality … abides having entered upon the first jhāna. ",
  "mn53:18.3": "second jhāna … ",
  "mn53:18.4": "third jhāna … ",
  "mn53:18.5": "fourth jhāna. ",
  "mn53:18.6": "That’s how a noble disciple gets the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. ",
  "mn53:19.1": "When a noble disciple is accomplished in virtue, guards the sense doors, is moderate in eating, and is dedicated to vigilance, has seven good qualities, and gets the four jhānas—easeful abidings in the present experience that involve an elevated mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme safety from the yoke. ",
  "mn53:19.2": "Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that chicken doesn’t wish, ",
  "mn53:19.3": "‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ ",
  "mn53:19.4": "Still they can break out and hatch safely. ",
  "mn53:19.5": "In the same way, when a noble disciple is endowed with all these factors, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme safety from the yoke. ",
  "mn53:20.1": "Relying on this supreme purity of recollection and equanimity, that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives. ",
  "mn53:20.2": "That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

  "mn53:25.3": "‘The aristocrat is best among people ",
  "mn53:25.4": "who take clan as the standard. ",
  "mn53:25.5": "But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct ",
  "mn53:25.6": "is best among gods and humans.’ ",
  "mn53:25.7": "And that verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by the Buddha.” ",
  "mn53:26.1": "Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda, ",
  "mn53:26.2": "“Good, good, Ānanda! ",
  "mn53:26.3": "It’s good that you spoke to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the practicing trainee.” ",
