    "mn53:3.1": "The Auspicious One consented with silence. ",
    "mn53:3.2": "Then, knowing that the Auspicious One had consented, the Sakyans arose from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Auspicious One, keeping him on their right.

    "mn53:5.1": "The Auspicious One spent much of the night educating, encouraging, invigorating, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda, ",

    "mn53:8.3": "on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, unbeneficial thoughts of longing and upset would arise in them. They practice to restrain that; they guard the eye faculty and bring about the restraint of the eye faculty. ",

    "mn53:14.1": "They are highly learned, remembering and keeping what they have learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the [right] meaning and phrasing, and which describe a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure—such teachings he has learned much of, remembered, rehearsed verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view.
