  "mn44:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "mn44:1.3": "Then the layman Visākha went to see the nun Dhammadinnā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her: ",
  "mn44:2.1": "“Ma’am, ‘personality, personality’, it is said. ",
  "mn44:2.2": "What has the Buddha referred to as personality?” ",
  "mn44:2.3": "“Visākha, the Buddha has referred to these five-assumption-aggregates as personality. ",
  "mn44:2.4": "That is, the assumed-aggregates of form, feeling, perception, activities, and consciousness. ",
  "mn44:2.5": "It is these five-assumption-aggregates that the Buddha has referred to as personality.” ",
  "mn44:2.6": "Saying “Good, ma’am,” Visākha approved and agreed with what the nun Dhammadinnā said. Then he asked another question: ",

  "mn44:3.2": "What has the Buddha referred to as the origin of personality?” ",
  "mn44:3.3": "“It’s the craving that leads to renewed being, accompanied by delight-and-passion, which delights wherever it lands. That is, ",

  "mn44:3.5": "This is what the Buddha has referred to as the origin of personality.” ",
  "mn44:4.1": "“Ma’am, ‘the cessation of personality, the cessation of personality’, it is said. ",
  "mn44:4.2": "What has the Buddha referred to as the cessation of personality?” ",
  "mn44:4.3": "It’s the fading and cessation of that very same craving without remainder; giving it up, letting it go, releasing it, and not resting upon it. ",

  "mn44:5.1": "“Ma’am, ‘the practice that leads to the cessation of personality, the practice that leads to the cessation of personality’, it is said. ",

  "mn44:5.3": "“The practice that leads to the cessation of personality that the Buddha has referred to is simply this Noble Eightfold Path, that is: ",
  "mn44:5.4": "right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right recollection, and right composure.” ",
  "mn44:6.1": "“But ma’am, is that assumption the same as the five-assumed-aggregates? Or is assumption one thing and the five-assumed-aggregates another?” ",
  "mn44:6.2": "“That assumption is not the same as the five-assumption-aggregates. Nor is assumption one thing and the five-assumed-aggregates another. ",
  "mn44:6.3": "It’s the desire-and-passion for the five-assumption-aggregates that is the assumption there.” ",
  "mn44:7.1": "“But ma’am, how is there personality-view?” ",
  "mn44:7.2": "“It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",

  "mn44:8.1": "“But ma’am, how is there not personality-view?” ",
  "mn44:8.2": "“It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",

  "mn44:10.2": "“The Noble Eightfold Path is determined.” ",
  "mn44:11.1": "“Are the three aggregates [of development] included in the Noble Eightfold Path? Or is the Noble Eightfold Path included in the three aggregates [of development]?” ",
  "mn44:11.2": "“The three aggregates [of development] are not included in the Noble Eightfold Path. Rather, the Noble Eightfold Path is included in the three aggregates [of development]. ",
  "mn44:11.3": "Right speech, right action, and right livelihood: these things are included in the aggregate of virtue. ",
  "mn44:11.4": "Right effort, right recollection, and right composure: these things are included in the aggregate of composure. ",
  "mn44:11.5": "Right view and right intention: these things are included in the aggregate of understanding.” ",
  "mn44:12.1": "“But ma’am, what is composure? What things are the basis of composure? What things are the requisites for composure? What is the development of composure?” ",
  "mn44:12.2": "“Unification of the mind is composure. ",

  "mn44:14.2": "“Breathing is the bodily activity. Thinking and pondering are the verbal activity. Perception and feeling are the mind-activity.” ",
  "mn44:15.1": "“But ma’am, why is breathing the bodily activity? Why are thinking and pondering the verbal activity? Why are perception and feeling the mind-activity?” ",
  "mn44:15.2": "“Breathing is bodily. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is the bodily activity. ",
  "mn44:15.3": "Having first thought and pondered, one breaks into speech. That’s why thinking and pondering are the verbal activity. ",
  "mn44:15.4": "Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are the mind-activity.” ",
  "mn44:16.1": "“But ma’am, how does someone attain the cessation of perception-and-feeling?” ",
  "mn44:16.2": "“A bhikkhu who is attaining the cessation of perception-and-feeling does not think: ",
  "mn44:16.3": "‘I will attain the cessation of perception-and-feeling’ or ‘I am attaining the cessation of perception-and-feeling’ or ‘I have attained the cessation of perception-and-feeling.’ ",
  "mn44:16.4": "Rather, his mind has been previously developed so as to lead to that.” ",

  "mn44:23.4": "That which is felt as unpleasant and disagreeable, whether bodily or mental. ",
  "mn44:23.5": "This is unpleasant feeling. ",
  "mn44:23.6": "That which is felt as neither-agreeable-nor-disagreeable, whether bodily or mental. ",
  "mn44:23.7": "This is neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling.” ",
  "mn44:24.1": "“What is pleasant and what is unpleasant in regard to each of the three feelings?” ",
  "mn44:24.2": "“Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and unpleasant when it deteriorates. ",

  "mn44:25.1": "“What underlying tendencies underlie each of the three feelings?” ",
  "mn44:25.2": "“The underlying tendency for passion underlies pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency for resistance underlies painful feeling. The underlying tendency for ignorance underlies neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling.” ",
  "mn44:26.1": "“Do these underlying tendencies always underlie these feelings?” ",
  "mn44:26.2": "“No, they do not.” ",
  "mn44:27.1": "“What should be given up in regard to each of these three feelings?” ",
  "mn44:27.2": "“The underlying tendency to passion should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to resistance should be given up when it comes to unpleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling.” ",
  "mn44:28.1": "“Should these underlying tendencies be given up in regard to all instances of these feelings?” ",
  "mn44:28.2": "“No, not in all instances. ",
  "mn44:28.3": "Take a bhikkhu who, quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from detrimental phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of separation, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. ",
  "mn44:28.4": "With this he gives up passion, and the underlying tendency to passion does not underlie that. ",
  "mn44:28.5": "And take a bhikkhu who reflects: ",
  "mn44:28.6": "‘Oh, when will I abide having entered upon the same sphere that the noble ones abide having entered at present?’ ",
  "mn44:28.7": "Nursing such a yearning for the supreme liberations gives rise to sadness due to yearning. ",
  "mn44:28.8": "With this he gives up resistance, and the underlying tendency to resistance does not underlie that. ",
  "mn44:28.9": "Take a bhikkhu who, with the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollection, abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna. ",
  "mn44:28.10": "With this he give ups ignorance, and the underlying tendency to ignorance does underlie that.” ",

  "mn44:29.16": "If you wish, go to the Buddha and ask him this question. You should remember it in line with his answer.” ",
  "mn44:30.1": "And then the layman Visākha, having delighted in and expressed appreciation for what the nun Dhammadinnā said, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right. Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, ",

  "mn44:30.5": "If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as the nun Dhammadinnā. ",
  "mn44:30.6": "That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.” ",
  "mn44:30.7": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn44:30.8": "Pleased, the layman Visākha delighted in what the Buddha said. "
