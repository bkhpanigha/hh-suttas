  "mn49:0.2": "On the Invitation of Brahmā ",
  "mn49:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn49:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn49:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn49:1.4": "“Bhikkhus!” ",
  "mn49:1.5": "“Bhante,” they replied. ",
  "mn49:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn49:2.1": "“At one time, bhikkhus, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree. ",
  "mn49:2.2": "Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: ",
  "mn49:2.3": "‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or reappearing. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’ ",
  "mn49:3.1": "Then I knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. ",
  "mn49:3.2": "As easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm, I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. ",
  "mn49:3.3": "Baka saw me coming off in the distance ",
  "mn49:3.4": "and said, ",
  "mn49:3.5": "‘Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir! ",
  "mn49:3.6": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. ",
  "mn49:3.7": "For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or reappearing. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’ ",
  "mn49:4.1": "When he had spoken, I said to him, ",
  "mn49:4.2": "‘Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! ",
  "mn49:4.3": "Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. ",
  "mn49:4.4": "And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and reappearing, he says that ",
  "mn49:4.5": "there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or reappearing. ",
  "mn49:4.6": "And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.’ ",
  "mn49:5.1": "Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmā’s retinue and said this to me, ",
  "mn49:5.2": "‘Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! Don’t attack this one! Don’t attack this one! For this is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who are and those who will be. ",
  "mn49:5.3": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, bhikkhu, who condemned and loathed earth, water, air, fire, beings, gods, the Progenitor, and Brahmā. ",
  "mn49:5.4": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they reappeared in a lower realm. ",
  "mn49:5.5": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, bhikkhu, who approved of and delighted in earth, water, air, fire, beings, gods, the Progenitor, and Brahmā. ",
  "mn49:5.6": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they reappeared in a higher realm. ",
  "mn49:5.7": "So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: ",
  "mn49:5.8": "Please, good sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā. ",
  "mn49:5.9": "If you do, then you’ll end up like a man who, when approached by Lady Luck, would ward her off with a staff; or who, as he’s falling over a cliff, would lose grip of the ground with his hands and feet. ",
  "mn49:5.10": "Please, good sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā. ",
  "mn49:5.11": "Do you not see the assembly of Brahmā gathered here?’ ",
  "mn49:5.12": "And so Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of Brahmā to me. ",
  "mn49:6.1": "When he had spoken, I said to Māra, ",
  "mn49:6.2": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think, ",
  "mn49:6.3": "“He does not know me.” ",
  "mn49:6.4": "You are Māra the Wicked. ",
  "mn49:6.5": "And Brahmā, Brahmā’s assembly, and Brahmā’s retinue have all fallen into your hands; they’re under your sway. ",
  "mn49:6.6": "And you think, ",
  "mn49:6.7": "“Maybe this one, too, has fallen into my hands; maybe he’s under my sway!” ",
  "mn49:6.8": "But I haven’t fallen into your hands; I’m not under your sway.’ ",
  "mn49:7.1": "When I had spoken, Baka the Brahmā said to me, ",
  "mn49:7.2": "‘But, good sir, what I say is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable is in fact permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. And where I say there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or reappearing, there is in fact ",
  "mn49:7.3": "no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or reappearing. ",
  "mn49:7.4": "And when I say there’s no other escape beyond this, there is in fact no other escape beyond this. ",
  "mn49:7.5": "There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you, bhikkhu, whose asceticism lasted as long as their entire life. ",
  "mn49:7.6": "When there was another escape beyond this, they knew it, and when there was no other escape beyond this, they knew it. ",
  "mn49:7.7": "So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: ",
  "mn49:7.8": "you will never find another escape beyond this, and you will eventually get weary and frustrated. ",
  "mn49:7.9": "If you rest upon earth, you will lie close to me, in my domain, subject to my will, and expendable. ",
  "mn49:7.10": "If you attach to water … ",
  "mn49:7.11": "fire … ",
  "mn49:7.12": "air … ",
  "mn49:7.13": "beings … ",
  "mn49:7.14": "gods … ",
  "mn49:7.15": "the Progenitor … ",
  "mn49:7.16": "Brahmā, you will lie close to me, in my domain, subject to my will, and expendable.’ ",
  "mn49:8.1": "‘Brahmā, I too know that ",
  "mn49:8.2": "if I rest upon earth, I will lie close to you, in your domain, subject to your will, and expendable. ",
  "mn49:8.3": "If I attach to water … ",
  "mn49:8.4": "fire … ",
  "mn49:8.5": "air … ",
  "mn49:8.6": "beings … ",
  "mn49:8.7": "gods … ",
  "mn49:8.8": "the Progenitor … ",
  "mn49:8.9": "Brahmā, I will lie close to you, in your domain, subject to your will, and expendable. And in addition, Brahmā, I understand your range and your splendor: ",
  "mn49:8.10": "“That’s how powerful is Baka the Brahmā, how illustrious and mighty.”’ ",
  "mn49:8.11": "‘But in what way do you understand my range and my splendor?’ ",
  "mn49:8.12": "",
  "mn49:9.1": "‘A thousand-fold world extends as far ",
  "mn49:9.2": "as the moon and sun revolve ",
  "mn49:9.3": "and the stars light up the directions. ",
  "mn49:9.4": "And there you wield your power. ",
  "mn49:9.5": "You know the high and low, ",
  "mn49:9.6": "the passionate and dispassionate, ",
  "mn49:9.7": "and the coming and going of beings ",
  "mn49:9.8": "from this realm to another. ",
  "mn49:9.9": "That’s how I understand your range and your splendor. ",
  "mn49:9.10": "",
  "mn49:10.1": "But there are three other realms that you don’t know or see, ",
  "mn49:10.2": "but which I know and see. ",
  "mn49:10.3": "There is the realm of the gods of streaming radiance. You passed away from there and reappeared here. ",
  "mn49:10.4": "You’ve dwelt here so long that you’ve forgotten about that, so you don’t know it or see it. ",
  "mn49:10.5": "But I know it and see it. ",
  "mn49:10.6": "So Brahmā, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior. ",
  "mn49:10.7": "Rather, I know more than you. ",
  "mn49:10.8": "There is the realm of the gods replete with glory … There is the realm of the gods of abundant fruit, which you don’t know or see. ",
  "mn49:10.9": "But I know it and see it. ",
  "mn49:10.10": "So Brahmā, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior. ",
  "mn49:10.11": "Rather, I know more than you. ",
  "mn49:11.1": "Having comprehended earth as earth, Brahmā, and having comprehended that which does not partake in the earthiness of earth, I did not become earth, I did not become in earth, I did not become apart from earth, I did not become ‘earth is mine’, I did not welcome earth. ",
  "mn49:11.2": "So Brahmā, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior. ",
  "mn49:11.3": "Rather, I know more than you. ",
  "mn49:12.1": "Having comprehended water … ",
  "mn49:13.1": "fire … ",
  "mn49:14.1": "air … ",
  "mn49:15.1": "beings … ",
  "mn49:16.1": "gods … ",
  "mn49:17.1": "the Progenitor … ",
  "mn49:18.1": "Brahmā … ",
  "mn49:19.1": "the gods of streaming radiance … ",
  "mn49:20.1": "the gods replete with glory … ",
  "mn49:21.1": "the gods of abundant fruit … ",
  "mn49:22.1": "the Conqueror … ",
  "mn49:23.1": "Having comprehended the All as the All, Brahmā, and having comprehended that which does not partake in the Allness of the All, I did not become the All, I did not become in the All, I did not become apart from the All, I did not become ‘the All is mine’, I did not welcome the All. ",
  "mn49:23.2": "So Brahmā, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior. ",
  "mn49:23.3": "Rather, I know more than you.’ ",
  "mn49:24.1": "‘Well, good sir, if you have comprehended that which does not partake in the Allness of the All, may your words not turn out to be void and hollow.’ ",
  "mn49:25.1": "‘Non-indicative consciousness, infinite and entirely lucid—that is what does not partake in the earthiness of earth, the wateriness of water, the fieriness of fire, the airiness of air, the beingness of beings, the godliness of gods, the Progenitorness of the Progenitor, the Brahmāness of Brahmā, the streaming-radiance-ness of the gods of streaming radiance, the replete-with-glory-ness of the gods replete with glory, the abundant-fruit-ness of the gods of abundant fruit, the Conqueror-ness of the Conqueror, and the Allness of the All.’ ",
  "mn49:26.1": "‘Well look now, good sir, I will vanish from you!’ ",
  "mn49:26.2": "‘All right, then, Brahmā, vanish from me—if you can.’ ",
  "mn49:26.3": "Then Baka the Brahmā said, ",
  "mn49:26.4": "‘I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama! I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama!’ But he was unable to vanish from me. ",
  "mn49:26.5": "So I said to him, ",
  "mn49:26.6": "‘Well now, Brahmā, I will vanish from you!’ ",
  "mn49:26.7": "‘All right, then, good sir, vanish from me—if you can.’ ",
  "mn49:26.8": "Then I used my psychic power to will that ",
  "mn49:26.9": "my voice would extend so that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue would hear me, but they would not see me. ",
  "mn49:26.10": "And while vanished I recited this verse: ",
  "mn49:27.1": "‘Seeing the danger in being—",
  "mn49:27.2": "and the being of those who seek non-being—",
  "mn49:27.3": "I didn’t welcome any being at all, ",
  "mn49:27.4": "and didn’t grasp at delight.’ ",
  "mn49:28.1": "Then Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought, ",
  "mn49:28.2": "‘Oh, how incredible, how amazing! ",
  "mn49:28.3": "The ascetic Gotama has such psychic power and might! We’ve never before seen or heard of any other ascetic or brahmin with psychic power and might like the ascetic Gotama, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan. ",
  "mn49:28.4": "Though people enjoy being and are happy with it, he has extracted it with very its root.’ ",
  "mn49:29.1": "Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmā’s retinue and said this to me, ",
  "mn49:29.2": "‘If such is your understanding, good sir, do not present it to your disciples or those gone forth! ",
  "mn49:29.3": "Do not teach this Dhamma to your disciples or those gone forth! ",
  "mn49:29.4": "Do not wish this for your disciples or those gone forth! ",
  "mn49:29.5": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, bhikkhu, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas. ",
  "mn49:29.6": "They presented, taught, and wished this for their disciples and those gone forth. ",
  "mn49:29.7": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off, they reappeared in a lower realm. ",
  "mn49:29.8": "But there have also been other ascetics and brahmins before you, bhikkhu, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas. ",
  "mn49:29.9": "They did not present, teach, or wish this for their disciples and those gone forth. ",
  "mn49:29.10": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off, they reappeared in a higher realm. ",
  "mn49:29.11": "So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: ",
  "mn49:29.12": "Please, good sir, remain passive. Just devote yourself to abiding at ease in the present experience, for this is better left unsaid. Good sir, do not instruct others.’ ",
  "mn49:30.1": "When he had spoken, I said to Māra, ",
  "mn49:30.2": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think, ",
  "mn49:30.3": "“He doesn’t know me.” ",
  "mn49:30.4": "You are Māra the Wicked. ",
  "mn49:30.5": "You don’t speak to me like this out of compassion, ",
  "mn49:30.6": "but with no compassion. ",
  "mn49:30.7": "For you think, ",
  "mn49:30.8": "“Those who the ascetic Gotama teaches will go beyond my reach.” ",
  "mn49:30.9": "Those who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened Buddhas. ",
  "mn49:30.10": "But I claim to be a fully awakened Buddha while in fact being one. ",
  "mn49:30.11": "The Realized One remains as such whether or not he teaches disciples. ",
  "mn49:30.12": "The Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciples. ",
  "mn49:30.13": "Why is that? ",
  "mn49:30.14": "Because for the Realized One, the influxes that are defiling, involving repeated being, troublesome, resulting in suffering, leading to future birth, aging, and death, are given up. ",
  "mn49:30.15": "They are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. ",
  "mn49:30.16": "Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth, ",
  "mn49:30.17": "so too, for the the Realized One, the influxes that are defiling, involving repeated being, troublesome, resulting in suffering, leading to future birth, aging, and death ",
  "mn49:30.18": "are given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.’” ",
  "mn49:31.1": "And so, because of the silencing of Māra, and because of the invitation of Brahmā, the name of this discussion is “On the Invitation of Brahmā”. "
