    "mn5:1.5": "“Friend,” they replied. ",
    "mn5:1.6": "Venerable Sāriputta said this: ",

    "mn5:2.3": "One person with a blemish doesn’t understand as it is: ‘There is a blemish in me.’ ",

    "mn5:6.1": "Take the case of the person who doesn’t have a blemish but does not understand it. You can expect that they will apply their mind to the significance of beauty, and because of that, passion will infect their mind. ",

They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking effort. They’re forgetful, lacking comprehension and composure, with straying minds, witless and foolish. Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this exposition of the Dhamma as if he knows my heart with his heart! ",

They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are dedicated to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re effortful and determined. Their recollection is established, and they are comprehending and composed, with unified minds; possessing understanding, not foolish. Hearing this exposition of the Dhamma from Venerable Sāriputta, they drink it up and devour it, as it were. And in speech and thought they say: ",
    "mn5:32.3": "‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his fellow renunciates away from the unfavorable and establishes them in the favorable.’ ",
    "mn5:33.1": "Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. Presented with a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head. ",
    "mn5:33.2": "In the same way, those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith … say: ",
