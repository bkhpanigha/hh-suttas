    "mn58:1.1": "Thus have I heard. ",
    "mn58:1.2": "At one time, the Auspicious One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
    "mn58:2.1": "Then Prince Abhaya approached the Jain Nāṭaputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Jain Nāṭaputta said to him, ",
    "mn58:3.1": "“Come, prince, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. ",
    "mn58:3.2": "Then you will get a good reputation: ",
    "mn58:3.3": "‘Prince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’” ",
    "mn58:3.4": "“But, venerable sir, how am I to do this?” ",
    "mn58:3.5": "“Here, prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him: ",
    "mn58:3.6": "‘Venerable sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?’ ",
    "mn58:3.7": "When he is asked this, if he answers: ",
    "mn58:3.8": "‘He may, prince,’ say this to him, ",
    "mn58:3.9": "‘Then, venerable sir, what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary person? ",
    "mn58:3.10": "For even an ordinary person, may utter speech that is disliked by others.’ ",
    "mn58:3.11": "But if he answers, ",
    "mn58:3.12": "‘He may not, prince,’ say this to him: ",
    "mn58:3.13": "‘Then, venerable sir, why exactly did you declare of Devadatta: ",
    "mn58:3.14": "“Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable”? ",
    "mn58:3.15": "Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’ ",
    "mn58:3.16": "When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha will not be able to either spit it out or swallow it down. ",
    "mn58:3.17": "He will be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat, unable to either spit it out or swallow it down.” ",
    "mn58:3.18": "",
    "mn58:4.1": "“Yes, venerable sir,” replied Abhaya. He arose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Jain Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then, he went to the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. ",
    "mn58:4.2": "Then he looked up at the sun and thought, ",
    "mn58:4.3": "“It is too late to refute the Auspicious One’s doctrine today. ",
    "mn58:4.4": "I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow.” He said to the Auspicious One, ",
    "mn58:4.5": "“Venerable sir, may the Auspicious One kindly accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.” ",
    "mn58:4.6": "The Auspicious One consented with silence. ",
    "mn58:5.1": "Then, knowing that the Auspicious One had consented, Abhaya arose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Auspicious One, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
    "mn58:5.2": "Then, when the night had passed, the Auspicious One dressed in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Abhaya’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out. ",
    "mn58:5.3": "Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Auspicious One with his own hands with fine, fresh, and cooked foods. ",
    "mn58:5.4": "When the Auspicious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Abhaya took a low seat, sat to one side, ",
    "mn58:6.1": "and said to him, ",
    "mn58:6.2": "“Venerable sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?” ",
    "mn58:6.3": "“This matter is not categorical, prince.” ",
    "mn58:6.4": "“Then the Jains have lost in this, venerable sir.” ",
    "mn58:6.5": "“But prince, why do you say that ",
    "mn58:6.6": "the Jains have lost in this?” ",
    "mn58:6.7": "Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happened. ",

    "mn58:7.1": "At that time, a young, tender infant was sitting in Prince Abhaya’s lap. ",
    "mn58:7.2": "Then the Auspicious One said to Abhaya, ",
    "mn58:7.3": "“What do you think, prince? ",
    "mn58:7.4": "If—because of your negligence or his nursemaid’s negligence—this boy were to put a stick or stone in his mouth, what would you do to him?” ",
    "mn58:7.5": "“I would try to take it out, venerable sir. ",
    "mn58:7.6": "If that did not work, I would cradle his head with my left hand and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand, even if it drew blood. ",
    "mn58:7.7": "Why is that? ",
    "mn58:7.8": "Because I have compassion for the boy, venerable sir.” ",
    "mn58:8.1": "“In the same way, prince, the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and not beneficial, and which is disliked by others. ",

    "mn58:9.1": "“Venerable sir, there are clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics who come to see you with a question already planned. ",
    "mn58:9.2": "Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer just occur to you on the spot?” ",
    "mn58:10.1": "“Well then, prince, I will ask you about this in return, and you may answer as you wish. ",
    "mn58:10.2": "What do you think, prince? ",

    "mn58:10.10": "All the parts are well-known to me. ",
    "mn58:10.11": "The answer just occurs to me on the spot.” ",

    "mn58:11.2": "Why is that? ",
    "mn58:11.3": "Because the Realized One has fully penetrated that nature of things, through the full penetration of which the answer just occurs to him on the spot.” ",
