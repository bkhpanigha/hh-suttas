  "mn60:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. ",
  "mn60:2.3": "He has this good reputation: ",

  "mn60:2.5": "Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn60:2.6": "He teaches a Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that’s entirely complete and pure. ",
  "mn60:2.7": "It’s good to see such Arahants.” ",
  "mn60:3.1": "Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged pleasantries, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them: ",
  "mn60:4.1": "“So, householders, is there any teacher you’re pleased with, in whom you have acquired grounded faith?” ",

  "mn60:5.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ",
  "mn60:5.2": "‘There’s no giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad actions. This world doesn’t exist, nor the other world. There is no mother or father, nor beings that reappear spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having comprehended and experienced it for himself, makes known this world and the other.’ ",
