  "mn60:2.1": "The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard: ",
  "mn60:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. ",
  "mn60:2.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "mn60:2.4": "‘That Auspicious One is an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "mn60:2.5": "Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods, and humans—, he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn60:2.6": "He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that is entirely complete and pure. ",
  "mn60:2.7": "It is good to see such Arahants.” ",
  "mn60:3.1": "Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā approached the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged pleasantries, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them: ",
  "mn60:4.1": "“So, householders, is there any teacher you are pleased with, in whom you have acquired grounded faith?” ",
  "mn60:4.2": "“No, venerable sir.” ",
  "mn60:4.3": "“Since you have not found a teacher you are pleased with, you should undertake and implement this unfailing teaching. ",

  "mn60:5.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ",
  "mn60:5.2": "‘There is no giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There is no fruit or result of good and bad actions. This world does not exist, nor the other world. There is no mother or father, nor beings that reappear spontaneously. And there is no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having comprehended and experienced it for himself, makes known this world and the other.’ ",
  "mn60:6.1": "And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this. ",
