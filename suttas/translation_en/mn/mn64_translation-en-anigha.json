  "mn64:2.9": "and ill will. ",
  "mn64:2.10": "That’s how I remember the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha.” ",
  "mn64:3.1": "“Who on earth do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that way? ",
  "mn64:3.2": "Wouldn’t the wanderers of other religions fault you using the simile of the infant? ",
  "mn64:3.3": "For a young tender infant lying prone lying prone doesn’t even have a concept of ‘personality’, so how could personality-view possibly arise in them? ",
  "mn64:3.4": "Yet the underlying tendency to personality-view still underlies him. ",
  "mn64:3.5": "A young tender infant lying prone lying prone doesn’t even have a concept of ‘teachings’, so how could doubt about teachings possibly arise in them? ",

  "mn64:4.5": "“Yes, Bhante” Ānanda replied. ",
  "mn64:4.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn64:5.1": "“Ānanda, take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
  "mn64:5.2": "They live with a mind that’s prepossessed and overcome by personality-view, ",
  "mn64:5.3": "and they don’t understand as it is the escape from arisen personality-view. ",
  "mn64:5.4": "That personality-view is entrenched in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter. ",

  "mn64:6.16": "There is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters. It’s not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practice. ",

  "mn64:6.19": "In the same way, there is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters. It’s not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practice. ",

  "mn64:8.3": "Suppose the river Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. ",
  "mn64:8.4": "Then along comes a feeble person, who thinks: ",
  "mn64:8.5": "‘By swimming with my arms I’ll safely cross over to the far shore of the Ganges.’ ",
  "mn64:8.6": "But they’re not able to do so. ",
  "mn64:8.7": "In the same way, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of personality-view, someone whose mind doesn’t leap at it, and isn’ṭ confident, settled, and liberated in it, ",

  "mn64:9.1": "And what, Ānanda, is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters? ",
  "mn64:9.2": "It’s when a bhikkhu—due to the disjoining from appropriation, the giving up of detrimental qualities, and the complete calming of bodily discomforts—quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from detrimental phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and comfort born of separation, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. ",
  "mn64:9.3": "He regards whatever is there that’s included in form, feeling, perception, activities, and consciousness as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self. ",
  "mn64:9.4": "He turns his mind away from those phenomena, ",
  "mn64:9.5": "and directs it to the Deathless element: ",
  "mn64:9.6": "‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the appeasement of all activities, the letting go of all appropriation, the ending of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.’ ",
  "mn64:9.7": "When he’s steady in that, he reaches destruction of the influxes. ",
  "mn64:9.8": "If he doesn’t reach the destruction of the influxes, then due to that passion and delight in the Dhamma, with the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, he reappears spontaneously. He is extinguished there, and is not liable to return from that world. ",
  "mn64:9.9": "This is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
  "mn64:10-12.1": "‘Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering … abides having entered upon the second jhāna.’ ",
  "mn64:10-12.2": "third jhāna … ",

  "mn64:10-12.6": "If he doesn’t attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
  "mn64:10-12.7": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
  "mn64:13.1": "Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite space. ",
  "mn64:13.2": "He regards whatever is there that’s included in feeling, perception, activities, and consciousness … ",
  "mn64:13.3": "He turns his mind away from those things … ",
  "mn64:13.4": "If he doesn’t attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
  "mn64:13.5": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
  "mn64:14.1": "Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite consciousness. ",
  "mn64:14.2": "He regards whatever is there that’s included in feeling, perception, activities, and consciousness … ",
  "mn64:14.3": "He turns his mind away from those things … ",
  "mn64:14.4": "If he doesn’t attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
  "mn64:14.5": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
  "mn64:15.1": "Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, abides having entered upon the extent of nothingness. ",
  "mn64:15.2": "He regards whatever is there that’s included in feeling, perception, activities, and consciousness … ",
  "mn64:15.3": "He turns his mind away from those things … ",
  "mn64:15.4": "If he doesn’t attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
  "mn64:15.5": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.” ",
  "mn64:16.1": "“Bhante, if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters, how come some bhikkhus here are liberated by mind while others are liberated by understanding?” ",
  "mn64:16.2": "“In that case, I say it is the multiplicity of their faculties.” ",
  "mn64:16.3": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn64:16.4": "Pleased, Venerable Ānanda delighted in what the Buddha said. "
