    "mn64:3.1": "“Māluṅkyaputta, who in the world do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that way? ",
    "mn64:3.2": "Would the wanderers of other teachings not fault you using the simile of the infant? ",
    "mn64:3.3": "For a young tender infant lying prone lying prone does not even have a concept of ‘personality’, so how could personality-view possibly arise in him? ",
    "mn64:3.4": "Yet, the underlying tendency to personality-view still underlies him. ",

    "mn64:9.2": "It is when a bhikkhu—owing to withdrawal from appropriation, abandonment of unbeneficial qualities, and complete calming of bodily discomforts—having thoroughly withdrawn from sensuality, having withdrawn from unbeneficial phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of withdrawal, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. ",
    "mn64:9.3": "He regards whatever is there that is included in form, feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as empty, as not-self. ",
    "mn64:9.4": "He averts his mind from those phenomena, ",
    "mn64:9.5": "and directs it to the Deathless element: ",
    "mn64:9.6": "‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the appeasement of all activations, the relinquishment of all appropriation, the ending of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.’ ",
    "mn64:9.7": "When he is steady in that, he attains the destruction of the influxes. ",
    "mn64:9.8": "If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes, then due to that passion and delight in the Dhamma, with the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, he reappears spontaneously. He is extinguished there, and is not liable to return from that world. ",
    "mn64:9.9": "This is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
    "mn64:10-12.1": "‘Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering … abides having entered upon the second jhāna.’ ",

    "mn64:10-12.6": "If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
    "mn64:10-12.7": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
    "mn64:13.1": "Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite space. ",
    "mn64:13.2": "He regards whatever is there that is included in feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness … ",
    "mn64:13.3": "He averts his mind from those things … ",
    "mn64:13.4": "If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
    "mn64:13.5": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
    "mn64:14.1": "Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, abides having entered upon the extent of infinite consciousness. ",
    "mn64:14.2": "He regards whatever is there that is included in feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness … ",
    "mn64:14.3": "He averts his mind from those things … ",
    "mn64:14.4": "If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes, … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
    "mn64:14.5": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters. ",
    "mn64:15.1": "Furthermore, a bhikkhu, having fully surmounted the extent of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, abides having entered upon the extent of nothingness. ",
    "mn64:15.2": "He regards whatever is there that is included in feeling, perception, activations, and consciousness … ",
    "mn64:15.3": "He averts his mind from those things … ",
    "mn64:15.4": "If he does not attain the destruction of the influxes … and is not liable to return from that world. ",
    "mn64:15.5": "This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.” ",
    "mn64:16.1": "“Venerable sir, if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters, why is it that some bhikkhus here are liberated by mind while others are liberated by understanding?” ",
    "mn64:16.2": "“In that case, I say that it is the multiplicity of their faculties.” ",
    "mn64:16.3": "That is what the Auspicious One said. ",
    "mn64:16.4": "Pleased, Venerable Ānanda delighted in what the Auspicious One said. "
