  "mn41:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn41:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā. ",
  "mn41:2.1": "The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard, ",
  "mn41:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. ",
  "mn41:2.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "mn41:2.4": "‘That Blessed One is an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "mn41:2.5": "Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn41:2.6": "He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. ",
  "mn41:2.7": "And he reveals a renunciate life that’s entirely complete and pure. ",
  "mn41:2.8": "It’s good to see such worthy ones.” ",
  "mn41:3.1": "Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged pleasantries, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha: ",
  "mn41:4.1": "“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell? ",
  "mn41:4.2": "And what is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm?” ",
  "mn41:5.1": "“Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",
  "mn41:5.2": "Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.” ",
  "mn41:6.1": "“We don’t understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama’s brief statement. ",
  "mn41:6.2": "Master Gotama, please teach us this matter in detail so we can understand the meaning.” ",
  "mn41:6.3": "“Well then, householders, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn41:6.4": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn41:6.5": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn41:7.1": "“Householders, unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind. ",
  "mn41:8.1": "And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of body? ",
  "mn41:8.2": "It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living creatures. ",
  "mn41:8.3": "They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. ",
  "mn41:8.4": "They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. ",
  "mn41:8.5": "This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body. ",
  "mn41:9.1": "And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct fourfold by way of speech? ",
  "mn41:9.2": "It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. ",
  "mn41:9.3": "They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division. ",
  "mn41:9.4": "They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to composure. ",
  "mn41:9.5": "They engage in frivolous speech. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless. ",
  "mn41:9.6": "This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is fourfold by way of speech. ",
  "mn41:10.1": "And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of mind? ",
  "mn41:10.2": "It's when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’ ",
  "mn41:10.3": "They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’ ",
  "mn41:10.4": "They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted: ",
  "mn41:10.5": "‘There’s no giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad actions. This world doesn’t exist, nor the other world. There is no mother or father, nor beings that reappear spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having comprehended and experienced it for himself, makes known this world and the other.’ ",
  "mn41:10.6": "This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of mind. ",
  "mn41:10.7": "That’s how unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some beings, when their body breaks up, after death, reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",
  "mn41:11.1": "Householders, principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind. ",
  "mn41:12.1": "And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of body? ",
  "mn41:12.2": "It’s when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings. ",
  "mn41:12.3": "They give up taking what is not given. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. ",
  "mn41:12.4": "They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. ",
  "mn41:12.5": "This is how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body. ",
  "mn41:13.1": "And how is principled and moral conduct fourfold by way of speech? ",
  "mn41:13.2": "It’s when a certain person gives up lying. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. ",
  "mn41:13.3": "They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. ",
  "mn41:13.4": "They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. ",
  "mn41:13.5": "They give up frivolous speech. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and discipline. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. ",
  "mn41:13.6": "This is how principled and moral conduct is fourfold by way of speech. ",
  "mn41:14.1": "And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of mind? ",
  "mn41:14.2": "It's when a certain person is not covetous. They don’t covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’ ",
  "mn41:14.3": "They have a mind free from ill will and of corrupt intentions, thinking: ‘May these beings live free of enmity and affliction, untroubled and at ease!’ ",
  "mn41:14.4": "They have right view, undistorted perspective: ",
  "mn41:14.5": "‘There is giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad actions. There is this world, and there is the other world. There is mother and father, and beings that reappear spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having for themselves comprehended and experienced it, make known this world and the other.’ ",
  "mn41:14.6": "This is how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of mind. ",

  "mn41:15.1": "A person of principled and moral conduct might wish: ",
  "mn41:15.2": "‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would reappear in fellowship with well-to-do aristocrats!’ ",
  "mn41:15.3": "It’s possible that this might happen. ",
  "mn41:15.4": "Why is that? ",
