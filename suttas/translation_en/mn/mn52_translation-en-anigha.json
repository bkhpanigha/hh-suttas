  "mn52:1.2": "At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva. ",
  "mn52:1.3": "Now at that time the householder Dasama, a wealthy citizen, had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business. ",
  "mn52:2.1": "He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain bhikkhu, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
  "mn52:2.2": "“Bhante, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying? ",
  "mn52:2.3": "For I want to see him.” ",
  "mn52:2.4": "“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.” ",
  "mn52:3.1": "Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda: ",
  "mn52:3.2": "“Venerable Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the Arahant, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a heedful, diligent and resolute bhikkhu’s mind is liberated, his influxes are destroyed, and he arrives at the supreme safety from the yoke?” ",
  "mn52:3.3": "“There is, householder.” ",
  "mn52:3.4": "“And what is that one thing?” ",
  "mn52:4.1": "“It’s when a bhikkhu, quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from detrimental phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and comfort born of separation, abides having entered upon the first jhāna. ",

  "mn52:4.5": "Abiding in that, he attains the destruction of the influxes. ",
  "mn52:4.6": "If he doesn’t attain the destruction of the influxes, with the destruction of the five lower fetters he reappears spontaneously, because of that passion and delight in the Dhamma. He is extinguished there, and is not liable to return from that world. ",
  "mn52:4.7": "This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the Arahant, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a heedful, diligent and resolute bhikkhu’s mind is liberated, his influxes are destroyed, and he arrives at the supreme safety from the yoke.

  "mn52:15.4": "Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire they’d be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors. ",
  "mn52:15.5": "In the same way, I’m able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to the Deathless. ",
  "mn52:15.6": "Bhante, those of other religions seek a fee for the teacher. Why shouldn’t I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?” ",
  "mn52:16.1": "Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with fine fresh and cooked foods. ",
  "mn52:16.2": "He clothed each and every bhikkhu in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda. "
