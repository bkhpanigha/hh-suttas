  "mn37:0.2": "The Shorter Discourse on the Destruction of Craving ",
  "mn37:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn37:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. ",
  "mn37:2.1": "And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: ",
  "mn37:2.2": "“Bhante, how do you briefly define a bhikkhu who is liberated through the destruction of craving, who is totally finished, abides in the complete safety from the yoke, leads the ultimate renunciate life, has arrived at the final goal, and is best among gods and humans?” ",
  "mn37:3.1": "“Lord of Gods, take a bhikkhu who has heard: ",
  "mn37:3.2": "‘All phenomena are not worth fixating on.’ ",
  "mn37:3.3": "When a bhikkhu has heard that ",
  "mn37:3.4": "all phenomena are not worth fixating on, ",
  "mn37:3.5": "he comprehends the whole Dhamma. Having comprehended the whole Dhamma, he completely understands the whole Dhamma. Having completely understood the whole Dhamma, whatever feeling he experiences—pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant— ",
  "mn37:3.6": "he abides maintaining perspective of impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment concurrently with those feelings. ",
  "mn37:3.7": "As he abides maintaining perspective of impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment concurrently with those feelings, he does not assume anything in the world. ",
  "mn37:3.8": "Not assuming, he is not perturbed; not being perturbed, he is personally quenched. ",
  "mn37:3.9": "He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the renunciate life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no more of this.’ ",
  "mn37:3.10": "“That is how I briefly define a bhikkhu who is liberated through the destruction of craving, who is totally finished, abides in the complete safety from the yoke, leads the ultimate renunciate life, has arrived at the final goal, and is best among gods and humans.” ",
  "mn37:4.1": "Then Sakka, lord of gods, having delighted in and expressed appreciation for what the Buddha said, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. ",
  "mn37:5.1": "Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha. ",
  "mn37:5.2": "He thought, ",
  "mn37:5.3": "“Had that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he expressed his appreciation, or not? ",
  "mn37:5.4": "Why do not I find out?” ",
  "mn37:5.5": "",
  "mn37:6.1": "And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm, vanished from the Eastern Monastery and reappeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three. ",
  "mn37:7.1": "Now at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park, supplied and provided with a divine orchestra. ",
  "mn37:7.2": "Seeing Venerable Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance, ",
  "mn37:7.3": "he dismissed the orchestra, approached Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, and said, ",
  "mn37:7.4": "“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good Moggallāna! ",
  "mn37:7.5": "It has been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. ",
  "mn37:7.6": "Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.” ",
  "mn37:7.7": "Venerable Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread out, ",
  "mn37:7.8": "while Sakka took a low seat and sat to one side. ",
  "mn37:7.9": "Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him, ",
  "mn37:8.1": "“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain liberation through the destruction of craving? ",
  "mn37:8.2": "Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.” ",
  "mn37:8.3": "“My good Moggallāna, I have many duties, and much to do, ",
  "mn37:8.4": "not only for myself, but also for the Gods of the Thirty-Three. ",
  "mn37:8.5": "Still, what is properly heard, learned, attended to, and kept in mind does not vanish all of a sudden. ",
  "mn37:8.6": "Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the titans. ",
  "mn37:8.7": "In that battle the gods won and the titans lost. ",
  "mn37:8.8": "When I returned from that battle as a conqueror, I created the Palace of Victory. ",
  "mn37:8.9": "The Palace of Victory has a hundred towers. ",
  "mn37:8.10": "Each tower has seven hundred chambers. ",
  "mn37:8.11": "Each chamber has seven nymphs. ",
  "mn37:8.12": "Each nymph has seven maids. ",
  "mn37:8.13": "Would you like to see the lovely Palace of Victory?” ",
  "mn37:8.14": "Venerable Mahāmoggallāna consented with silence. ",
  "mn37:9.1": "Then, putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front, Sakka, lord of gods, and Vessavaṇa, the Great King, went to the Palace of Victory. ",
  "mn37:9.2": "When they saw Venerable Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maids, ",
  "mn37:9.3": "remorseful and ashamed, each went to her own bedroom. ",
  "mn37:10.1": "They were just like a daughter-in-law who feels ashamed and afraid [of wrongdoing] when she sees her father-in-law. ",
  "mn37:10.2": "",
  "mn37:10.3": "Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Venerable Mahāmoggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying, ",
  "mn37:10.4": "“See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing! ",
  "mn37:10.5": "And that lovely thing!” ",
  "mn37:10.6": "“That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past. ",
  "mn37:10.7": "Humans, when they see something lovely, also say: ",
  "mn37:10.8": "‘It looks beautiful enough for the Gods of the Thirty-Three!’ ",
  "mn37:10.9": "That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.” ",
  "mn37:11.1": "Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, ",
  "mn37:11.2": "“This spirit lives much too negligently. ",
  "mn37:11.3": "Why do not I stir up a sense of urgency in him?” ",
  "mn37:11.4": "Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe. ",
  "mn37:11.5": "Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the Gods of the Thirty-Three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought, ",
  "mn37:11.6": "“Oh, how incredible, how amazing! ",
  "mn37:11.7": "The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!” ",
  "mn37:12.1": "Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him, ",
  "mn37:12.2": "“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain liberation through the destruction of craving? ",
  "mn37:12.3": "Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.” ",
  "mn37:12.4": "“My dear Moggallāna, I approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, ",
  "mn37:12.5": "“Bhante, how do you briefly define a bhikkhu who is liberated through the destruction of craving, who is totally finished, abides in the complete safety from the yoke, leads the ultimate renunciate life, has arrived at the final goal, and is best among gods and humans?” ",
  "mn37:13.1": "When I had spoken the Buddha said to me: ",
  "mn37:13.2": "‘Lord of Gods, it is when a bhikkhu has heard: ",
  "mn37:13.3": "“Nothing is worth fixating on.” ",
  "mn37:13.4": "When a bhikkhu has heard that ",
  "mn37:13.5": "nothing is worth fixating on, ",
  "mn37:13.6": "he comprehends the whole Dhamma. Having comprehended the whole Dhamma, he completely understands the whole Dhamma. Having completely understood the whole Dhamma, whatever feeling he experiences—pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant— ",
  "mn37:13.7": "he abides maintaining perspective of impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment concurrently with those feelings. ",
  "mn37:13.8": "As he abides maintaining perspective of impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment concurrently with those feelings, he does not assume anything in the world. ",

  "mn37:13.10": "He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the renunciate life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no more of this.’ ",
  "mn37:13.11": "That is how I briefly define a bhikkhu who is liberated through the destruction of craving, who is totally finished, abides in the ultimate safety from the yoke, leads the ultimate renunciate life, has arrived at the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.’ ",
  "mn37:13.12": "That is how the Buddha briefly explained liberation through the destruction of craving to me.” ",
  "mn37:14.1": "Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, having delighted in and expressed appreciation for what Sakka said—as easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm—vanished from among the Gods of the Thirty-Three and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery. ",
  "mn37:14.2": "Soon after Venerable Mahāmoggallāna left, Sakka’s maids said to him, ",
  "mn37:14.3": "“Good sir, was that the Blessed One, your Teacher?” ",
  "mn37:14.4": "“No, it was not. ",
  "mn37:14.5": "That was my fellow renunciate Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.” ",
  "mn37:14.6": "“You are fortunate, good sir, so very fortunate, ",
  "mn37:14.7": "to have a fellow renunciate of such power and might! ",
  "mn37:14.8": "We cannot believe that is not the Blessed One, your Teacher!” ",
  "mn37:15.1": "Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
  "mn37:15.2": "“Bhante, do you recall briefly explaining liberation through the destruction of craving to a certain well-known and illustrious spirit?” ",
  "mn37:15.3": "“I do, Moggallāna.” And the Buddha retold all that happened when Sakka came to visit him, adding: ",
