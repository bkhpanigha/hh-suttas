  "mn107:0.2": "With Moggallāna the Accountant ",
  "mn107:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn107:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. ",
  "mn107:1.3": "Then the brahmin Moggallāna the Accountant went up to the Buddha, and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
  "mn107:1.4": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: ",
  "mn107:2.1": "“Master Gotama, in this stilt longhouse we can see sequential progress ",
  "mn107:2.2": "down to the last step of the staircase. ",
  "mn107:2.3": "Among the brahmins we can see sequential progress ",
  "mn107:2.4": "in learning the chants. ",
  "mn107:2.5": "Among archers we can see sequential progress ",
  "mn107:2.6": "in archery. ",
  "mn107:2.7": "Among us accountants, who earn a living by accounting, we can see sequential progress ",
  "mn107:2.8": "in calculation. ",
  "mn107:2.9": "For when we get an apprentice we first make them count: ",
  "mn107:2.10": "‘One one, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens.’ ",
  "mn107:2.11": "We even make them count up to a hundred. ",
  "mn107:2.12": "Is it possible to similarly describe a sequential training, sequential progress, and sequential practice in this teaching and discipline?” ",
  "mn107:3.1": "“It is possible, brahmin. ",
  "mn107:3.2": "Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit. ",
  "mn107:3.3": "In the same way, when the Realized One gets a person for training, he first guides them like this: ",
  "mn107:3.4": "‘Come, bhikkhu, live fulfilling virtue and the training rules. Live restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper behavior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, train in the training rules.’ ",
  "mn107:4.1": "When the bhikkhu is virtuous, the Realized One guides him further: ",
  "mn107:4.2": "‘Come, bhikkhu, guard your sense doors. When you see a sight with the eyes, don’t grasp at signs and features of it ",
  "mn107:4.3": "on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, detrimental phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on you. Practice to restrain that; guard the eye faculty and bring about the restraint of the eye faculty.’ ",
  "mn107:4.4": "When you hear a sound with the ear … ",
  "mn107:4.5": "When you smell an odor with the nose … ",
  "mn107:4.6": "When you taste a flavor with the tongue … ",
  "mn107:4.7": "When you touch a touch with the body … ",
  "mn107:4.8": "When you cognize a phenomenon with the mind, don’t grasp at signs and features of it ",
  "mn107:4.9": "on account of which—due to abiding with the mental faculty unrestrained—bad, detrimental phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on you. Practice to restrain that; guard the mental faculty and bring about the restraint of the mental faculty. ",
  "mn107:5.1": "When the bhikkhu has his sense doors guarded, the Realized One guides him further: ",
  "mn107:5.2": "‘Come, bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. ",
  "mn107:5.3": "Eat reflecting through-the-origin: ",
  "mn107:5.4": "‘Not for entertainment, indulgence, beautification, or adornment, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support the renunciate life. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ ",
  "mn107:6.1": "When the bhikkhu eats in moderation, the Realized One guides him further: ",
  "mn107:6.2": "‘Come, bhikkhu, be committed to vigilance. During the day, cleanse your mind of obstructive states while walking or sitting. During the first watch of the night, cleanse your mind of obstructive states while walking or sitting. During the second watch of the night, you should lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—recollected and aware, having set the intention to get up. Having gotten up in the last watch of the night, continue to cleanse your mind of obstructive states while walking or sitting.’ ",
  "mn107:7.1": "When the bhikkhu is committed to vigilance, the Realized One guides him further: ",
  "mn107:7.2": "‘Come, bhikkhu, be possessed of recollection-and-awareness. Act with awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.’ ",
  "mn107:8.1": "When the bhikkhu is possessed of recollection-and-awareness, the Realized One guides him further: ",
  "mn107:8.2": "‘Come, bhikkhu, frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.’ ",
  "mn107:9.1": "And he does so. ",
  "mn107:9.2": "After the meal, he returns from almsround, sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes recollection at the fore. ",
  "mn107:9.3": "Giving up longing in regard to the world, he abides with a mind rid of longing; he cleanses the mind of longing. ",
  "mn107:9.4": "Giving up ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind rid of ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings; he cleanses the mind of ill will and hatred. ",
  "mn107:9.5": "Giving up indolence-and-lethargy, he abides with a mind rid of indolence-and-lethargy, perceiving light, recollected, and aware; he cleanses the mind of indolence-and-lethargy. ",
  "mn107:9.6": "Giving up restlessness-and-anxiety, he abides without restlessness, his mind internally appeased; he cleanses the mind of restlessness-and-anxiety. ",
  "mn107:9.7": "Giving up doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, not uncertain about beneficial qualities; he cleanses the mind of doubt. ",
  "mn107:10.1": "He gives up these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken understanding. ",
  "mn107:10.2": "Then, quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from detrimental phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and comfort born of separation, he abides having entered upon the first jhāna. ",
  "mn107:10.3": "With the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and comfort born of composure, he abides having entered upon second jhāna. ",
  "mn107:10.4": "With the fading of joy, he abides equanimous, recollected, and aware, experiencing comfort with the body. He abides having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and comfortable.” ",
  "mn107:10.5": "With the giving up of comfort and discomfort—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without comfort or discomfort, with purity of equanimity and recollection, he abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna. ",
  "mn107:11.1": "That’s how I instruct the bhikkhus who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their goal, but live aspiring to the supreme safety from the yoke. ",
  "mn107:11.2": "But for those bhikkhus who are Arahants—who have destroyed the influxes, fulfilled the training, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, arrived at the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of being, and are liberated through the right, ultimate knowledge—these things lead to a comfortable abiding in the present experience, and to recollection-and-awareness.” ",
  "mn107:12.1": "When he had spoken, Moggallāna the Accountant said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn107:12.2": "“When his disciples are instructed and advised like this by Master Gotama, do all of them achieve the ultimate goal, Nibbāna, or do some of them fail?” ",
  "mn107:12.3": "“Some succeed, while others fail.” ",
  "mn107:13.1": "“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why, though Nibbāna is available, the path leading to Nibbāna is available, and Master Gotama is present to encourage them, ",
  "mn107:13.2": "still some succeed while others fail?” ",
  "mn107:14.1": "“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. ",
  "mn107:14.2": "What do you think, brahmin? ",
  "mn107:14.3": "Are you skilled in the road to Rājagaha?” ",
  "mn107:14.4": "“Yes, I am.” ",
  "mn107:14.5": "“What do you think, brahmin? ",
  "mn107:14.6": "Suppose a person was to come along who wanted to go to Rājagaha. ",
  "mn107:14.7": "He’d approach you and say: ",
  "mn107:14.8": "‘Sir, I wish to go to Rājagaha. ",
  "mn107:14.9": "Please point out the road to Rājagaha.’ ",
  "mn107:14.10": "Then you’d say to them: ",
  "mn107:14.11": "‘Here, mister, this road goes to Rājagaha. ",
  "mn107:14.12": "Go along it for a while, and you’ll see a certain village. Go along a while further, and you’ll see a certain town. ",
  "mn107:14.13": "Go along a while further and you’ll see Rājagaha with its delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds.’ ",
  "mn107:14.14": "Instructed like this by you, they might still take the wrong road, heading west. ",
  "mn107:14.15": "But a second person might come with the same question and receive the same instructions. ",

  "mn107:14.25": "What is the cause, brahmin, what is the reason why, though Rājagaha is available, the path leading to Rājagaha is available, and you are there to encourage them, ",
  "mn107:14.26": "one person takes the wrong path and heads west, while another arrives safely at Rājagaha?” ",
  "mn107:14.27": "“What can I do about that, Master Gotama? ",
  "mn107:14.28": "I am the one who shows the way.” ",
  "mn107:14.29": "“In the same way, though Nibbāna is available, the path leading to Nibbāna is available, and I am present to encourage them, ",

  "mn107:15.1": "When he had spoken, Moggallāna the Accountant said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn107:15.2": "“Master Gotama, there are those faithless individuals who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not committed to vigilance. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking effort. They’re forgetful, lacking awareness and composure, with straying minds, devoid of understanding and foolish. Master Gotama doesn’t associate with these. ",
  "mn107:15.3": "But there are those clansmen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are dedicated to vigilance. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re effortful and resolute. Their recollection is established, and they are aware and composed, with unified minds; possessing understanding, not foolish. Master Gotama associates with these. ",
  "mn107:16.1": "Of all kinds of fragrant root, spikenard is said to be the best. ",
  "mn107:16.2": "Of all kinds of fragrant heartwood, red sandalwood is said to be the best. ",
  "mn107:16.3": "Of all kinds of fragrant flower, jasmine is said to be the best. ",
  "mn107:16.4": "In the same way, Master Gotama’s advice is the best of contemporary teachings. ",
  "mn107:17.1": "Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! ",
  "mn107:17.2": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "mn107:17.3": "I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the bhikkhu Saṅgha. ",
  "mn107:17.4": "From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” "
