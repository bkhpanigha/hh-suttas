  "mn14:0.2": "The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering ",
  "mn14:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn14:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. ",
  "mn14:2.1": "Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
  "mn14:2.2": "“For a long time, Bhante, I have understood the Buddha's teaching like this: ",
  "mn14:2.3": "‘Greed, aversion, and muddledness are defilements of the mind.’ ",
  "mn14:2.4": " ",
  "mn14:2.5": " ",
  "mn14:2.6": "Despite understanding this, sometimes phenomena involving passion, aversion, and muddledness endure with a grip on your mind. ",
  "mn14:2.7": " ",
  "mn14:2.8": "I wonder what I have not internally given up, because of which sometimes states of passion, aversion, and muddledness endure with a grip on my mind?” ",
  "mn14:3.1": "“Mahānāma, this very thing is what you have not internally given up, because of which sometimes states of passion, aversion, and muddledness endure with a grip on your mind. ",
  "mn14:3.2": "For if you had given this up, you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensuality. ",
  "mn14:3.3": "But because you haven’t given this up, you are still living at home and enjoying sensuality. ",
  "mn14:4.1": "Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the woe in it is what's greater. ",
  "mn14:4.2": "Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has seen this as it is with right understanding, as long as they do not achieve the joy and comfort that are apart from sensuality and detrimental phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, ",
  "mn14:4.3": "they still might return to sensuality. ",
  "mn14:4.4": "But when they do achieve that joy and comfort, or something more peaceful than that, ",
  "mn14:4.5": "then they do not return to sensuality. ",
  "mn14:5.1": "Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right understanding that: ",
  "mn14:5.2": "‘Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the woe in them is what's greater.’ ",
  "mn14:5.3": "But so long as I didn’t achieve the joy and comfort that are apart from sensuality and detrimental phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, ",
  "mn14:5.4": "I didn’t claim that I would not return to sensuality. ",
  "mn14:5.5": "But when I did achieve that joy and comfort, or something more peaceful than that, ",
  "mn14:5.6": "then I claimed that I would not return to sensuality. ",
  "mn14:6.1": "And what is the gratification of sensuality? ",
  "mn14:6.2": "There are these five strands of sensuality. ",
  "mn14:6.3": "What five? ",
  "mn14:6.4": "What five? Sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing. ",
  "mn14:6.5": "Sounds cognizable by the ear … ",
  "mn14:6.6": "Smells cognizable by the nose … ",
  "mn14:6.7": "Tastes cognizable by the tongue … ",
  "mn14:6.8": "Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensuality, and enticing. ",
  "mn14:6.9": "These are the five strands of sensuality. ",
  "mn14:6.10": "The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five strands of sensuality: this is the gratification of sensuality. ",
  "mn14:6.11": " ",
  "mn14:7.1": "And what is the woe in sensuality? ",
  "mn14:7.2": "It’s when a clansman earns a living by means such as ",
  "mn14:7.3": "arithmetic, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. ",
  "mn14:7.4": "But he must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst. ",
  "mn14:7.5": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:8.1": "That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to earn any money. ",
  "mn14:8.2": "If this happens, he sorrows and wails and laments, beating his breast and becoming muddled, saying: ‘Oh, my hard work is wasted. My efforts are fruitless!’ ",
  "mn14:8.3": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:9.1": "That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, and succeed in earning money. ",
  "mn14:9.2": "But he experiences suffering and sadness when he tries to protect it, thinking: ",
  "mn14:9.3": "‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ ",
  "mn14:9.4": "And even though he protect its and wards it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. ",
  "mn14:9.5": "They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and becoming muddled: ",
  "mn14:9.6": "‘What once was mine is gone.’ ",
  "mn14:9.7": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:10.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend. ",
  "mn14:10.2": "Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords, ",
  "mn14:10.3": "resulting in death and deadly suffering. ",
  "mn14:10.4": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:11.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and plunge into a battle massed on both sides, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. ",
  "mn14:11.2": "There they are struck with arrows and spears, and their heads are chopped off, ",
  "mn14:11.3": "resulting in death and deadly suffering. ",
  "mn14:11.4": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:12.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and charge wetly plastered bastions, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. ",
  "mn14:12.2": "There they are struck with arrows and spears, splashed with dung, crushed by a superior force, and their heads are chopped off, ",
  "mn14:12.3": "resulting in death and deadly suffering. ",
  "mn14:12.4": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:13.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality they break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery. ",
  "mn14:13.2": "The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments— ",
  "mn14:13.3": "whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. ",
  "mn14:13.4": "These result in death and deadly suffering. ",
  "mn14:13.5": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:14.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality, they engage in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. ",
  "mn14:14.2": "When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",
  "mn14:14.3": "This is a woe in sensuality to do with what comes later, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn14:15.1": "Mahānāma, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "mn14:15.2": "Now at that time several Jains on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock were constantly standing, refusing seats. And they felt painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion. ",
  "mn14:16.1": "Then in the late afternoon, I came out of retreat and went to the Black Rock to visit those Jains. I said to them, ",
  "mn14:16.2": "‘Friends, why are you constantly standing, refusing seats, so that you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’ ",
  "mn14:17.1": "When I said this, those Jains said to me, ",
  "mn14:17.2": "‘Friend, the Jain Nāṭaputta, omniscient and all-seeing, claims to have complete knowledge-and-vision, thus: ",
  "mn14:17.3": "“knowledge-and-vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.” ",
  "mn14:17.4": "He says, ",
  "mn14:17.5": "“O Jains, you have done bad actions in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities. ",
  "mn14:17.6": "And when in the present you are restrained in body, speech, and thought, you’re not doing any bad actions for the future. ",
  "mn14:17.7": "So, due to eliminating past actions by fervent mortification, and not doing any new actions, there’s nothing to come up in the future. ",
  "mn14:17.8": "With no future consequence, actions end. With the ending of actions, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.” ",
  "mn14:17.9": "We endorse and accept this, and we are pleased by it.’ ",
  "mn14:18.1": "When they said this, I said to them, ",
  "mn14:18.2": "‘But friends, do you know ",
  "mn14:18.3": "for sure that you existed in the past, and it is not the case that you did not exist?’ ",
  "mn14:18.4": "‘No we don’t, friend.’ ",
  "mn14:18.5": "‘But friends, do you know ",
  "mn14:18.6": "for sure that you did bad actions in the past?’ ",
  "mn14:18.7": "‘No we don’t, friend.’ ",
  "mn14:18.8": "‘But friends, do you know ",
  "mn14:18.9": "that you did such and such bad actions?’ ",
  "mn14:18.10": "‘No we don’t, friend.’ ",
  "mn14:18.11": "‘But friends, do you know ",
  "mn14:18.12": "that so much suffering has already been worn away? Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away? Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn away?’ ",
  "mn14:18.13": "‘No we don’t, friend.’ ",
  "mn14:18.14": "‘But friends, do you know ",
  "mn14:18.15": "about giving up detrimental qualities and undertaking beneficial qualities right in the present experience?’ ",
  "mn14:18.16": "‘No we don’t, friend.’ ",
  "mn14:19.1": "‘So it seems that you don’t know any of these things. ",
  "mn14:19.2": " ",
  "mn14:19.3": " ",
  "mn14:19.4": " ",
  "mn14:19.5": " ",
  "mn14:19.6": " ",
  "mn14:19.7": " ",
  "mn14:19.8": "That being so, then when those in the world who are violent and bloody-handed and of cruel livelihood reappear among humans they go forth as Jains?’ ",
  "mn14:20.1": "‘Friend Gotama, pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through displeasure. ",
  "mn14:20.2": "For if pleasure were to be gained through pleasure, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha would gain pleasure, since he lives in greater pleasure than Venerable Gotama.’ ",
  "mn14:20.3": "‘Clearly the venerables have spoken rashly, without reflection. ",
  "mn14:20.4": " ",
  "mn14:20.5": " ",
  "mn14:20.6": "Rather, I’m the one who should be asked about ",
  "mn14:20.7": "who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or Venerable Gotama?’ ",
  "mn14:20.8": "‘Clearly we spoke rashly and without reflection. ",
  "mn14:20.9": " ",
  "mn14:20.10": "But let that be. Now we ask Venerable Gotama: ",
  "mn14:20.11": "“Who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or Venerable Gotama?”' ",
  "mn14:21.1": "‘Well then, friends, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. ",
  "mn14:21.2": "What do you think, friends? ",
  "mn14:21.3": "Is King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing total pleasure for seven days and nights without moving his body or speaking?’ ",
  "mn14:21.4": "‘No he is not, friend.’ ",
  "mn14:21.5": "‘What do you think, friends? ",
  "mn14:21.6": "Is King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing total pleasure for six days … ",
  "mn14:21.7": "five days … ",
  "mn14:21.8": "four days … ",
  "mn14:21.9": "three days … ",
  "mn14:21.10": "two days … ",
  "mn14:21.11": "one day?’ ",
  "mn14:21.12": "‘No he is not, friend.’ ",
  "mn14:21.13": "‘But I am capable of experiencing total pleasure for one day and night without moving my body or speaking. ",
  "mn14:21.14": "I am capable of experiencing total pleasure for two days … ",
  "mn14:21.15": "three days … ",
  "mn14:21.16": "four days … ",
  "mn14:21.17": "five days … ",
  "mn14:21.18": "six days … ",
  "mn14:21.19": "seven days. ",
  "mn14:21.20": "What do you think, friends? This being so, who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or I?’ ",
  "mn14:21.21": "‘This being so, Venerable Gotama lives in greater pleasure than King Bimbisāra.’” ",
  "mn14:21.22": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn14:21.23": "Pleased, Mahānāma the Sakyan delighted in what the Buddha said. "
