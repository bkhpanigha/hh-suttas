  "mn20:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn20:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn20:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn20:1.4": "“Bhikkhus!” ",
  "mn20:1.5": "“Bhante,” they replied. ",
  "mn20:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn20:2.1": "“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu committed to the higher mind should attend to five signs from time to time. ",
  "mn20:2.2": "What five? ",
  "mn20:3.1": "Take a bhikkhu who is attending to some sign due to which harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness are arising. That bhikkhu should attend to a different sign connected with the favorable. ",
  "mn20:3.2": "As he does so, those harmful, unfavorable thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:3.3": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. ",
  "mn20:3.4": "It’s like a deft carpenter or their apprentice who’d knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg. ",
  "mn20:3.5": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … should attend to a different sign connected with the favorable … ",
  "mn20:3.6": " ",
  "mn20:3.7": " ",
  "mn20:4.1": "Now, suppose that when a bhikkhu attends to a different sign connected with the favorable, harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness keep arising. He should consider the danger of those thoughts: ",
  "mn20:4.2": "‘So these thoughts are unfavorable, they’re blameworthy, and they result in suffering.’ ",
  "mn20:4.3": "As he does so, those harmful, unfavorable thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:4.4": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. ",
  "mn20:4.5": "Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted. ",
  "mn20:4.6": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … should consider the danger of those thoughts … ",
  "mn20:4.7": " ",
  "mn20:4.8": " ",
  "mn20:4.9": " ",
  "mn20:5.1": "Now, suppose that when a bhikkhu considers the danger of those thoughts, harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness keep arising. He should forget them and not pay attention to them. ",
  "mn20:5.2": "As he does so, those harmful, unfavorable thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:5.3": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. ",
  "mn20:5.4": "Suppose there was a person with good eyesight, and some undesirable forms came into range. ",
  "mn20:5.5": "He’d just close their eyes or look away. ",
  "mn20:5.6": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … those harmful thoughts are given up and come to an end … ",
  "mn20:5.7": " ",
  "mn20:6.1": "Now, suppose that when a bhikkhu ignores and doesn't pay attention to those thoughts, harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness keep arising. He should direct his mind to settling the thought-activity. ",
  "mn20:6.2": "As he does so, those harmful, unfavorable thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:6.3": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. ",
  "mn20:6.4": "Suppose there was a person walking quickly. ",
  "mn20:6.5": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.6": "‘Why am I walking quickly? ",
  "mn20:6.7": "Why don’t I slow down?’ ",
  "mn20:6.8": "So they’d slow down. ",
  "mn20:6.9": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.10": "‘Why am I walking slowly? ",
  "mn20:6.11": "Why don’t I stand still?’ ",
  "mn20:6.12": "So they’d stand still. ",
  "mn20:6.13": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.14": "‘Why am I standing still? ",
  "mn20:6.15": "Why don’t I sit down?’ ",
  "mn20:6.16": "So they’d sit down. ",
  "mn20:6.17": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.18": "‘Why am I sitting? ",
  "mn20:6.19": "Why don’t I lie down?’ ",
  "mn20:6.20": "So they’d lie down. ",
  "mn20:6.21": "And so that person would reject successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones. ",
  "mn20:6.22": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … those thoughts are given up and subside … ",
  "mn20:6.23": " ",
  "mn20:7.1": "Now, suppose that when a bhikkhu directs his mind to settling the thought-activity, harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness keep arising. ",
  "mn20:7.2": "With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, he should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. ",
  "mn20:7.3": "As he does so, those harmful, unfavorable thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:7.4": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. ",
  "mn20:7.5": "It’s like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them. ",
  "mn20:7.6": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … ",
  "mn20:7.7": "with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. ",
  "mn20:7.8": "As he does so, those harmful, unfavorable thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:7.9": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. ",
  "mn20:8.1": "When a bhikkhu who is attending to some sign due to which harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness are arising attends to a different sign connected with the favorable … ",
  "mn20:8.2": " ",
  "mn20:8.3": "... considers the danger of those thoughts … ",
  "mn20:8.4": " ",

  "mn20:8.10": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes composed. ",
  "mn20:8.11": "This is called a bhikkhu who is a master of the ways and modes of thought. ",
  "mn20:8.12": "He will think what he wants to think, and he won’t think what he doesn’t want to think. ",
  "mn20:8.13": "He’s cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.” ",
  "mn20:8.14": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn20:8.15": " Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Buddha said. ",
