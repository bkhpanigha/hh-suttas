  "mn57:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn57:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Haliddavasana. ",
  "mn57:2.1": "Then Puṇṇa the Koliyan, a cow votary, and the naked ascetic Seniya, a dog votary, went to see the Buddha. Puṇṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side, while Seniya exchanged pleasantries and polite conversation with him before sitting down to one side curled up like a dog. ",
  "mn57:2.2": "Puṇṇa said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn57:2.3": "“Bhante, this naked ascetic Seniya is a dog votary, one who does what is difficult. He eats food placed on the ground. ",
  "mn57:2.4": "For a long time he has undertaken that dog observance. ",
  "mn57:2.5": "What will be his destination? What will be his future?” ",
  "mn57:2.6": "“Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.” ",
  "mn57:2.7": "For a second time … ",
  "mn57:2.8": "and a third time, Puṇṇa said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn57:2.9": "“Bhante, this naked ascetic Seniya is a dog votary, one who does what is difficult. He eats food placed on the ground. ",
  "mn57:2.10": "For a long time he has undertaken that dog observance. ",

  "mn57:2.12": "“Clearly, Puṇṇa, I’m not getting through to you when I say: ",
  "mn57:2.13": "‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’ ",
  "mn57:2.14": "Nevertheless, I will answer you. ",
  "mn57:3.1": "Take someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a dog’s virtue, a dog’s mentality, and a dog’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly. ",
  "mn57:3.2": "When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in fellowship with dogs. ",
  "mn57:3.3": "But if they have such a view: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or renunciate life, I will become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view. ",
  "mn57:3.4": "One with wrong view reappears in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm. ",
  "mn57:3.5": "So, if the dog observance succeeds, it leads to fellowship with dogs. But if it fails, it leads to hell.” ",
  "mn57:4.1": "When he said this, the naked ascetic Seniya who was a dog votary cried and burst out in tears. ",
  "mn57:4.2": "The Buddha said to Puṇṇa, ",
  "mn57:4.3": "“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said: ",
  "mn57:4.4": "‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’” ",
  "mn57:4.5": "Seniya said, “Bhante, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said. ",

  "mn57:6.5": "Puṇṇa said, “Bhante, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn57:6.6": "But, Bhante, for a long time I have undertaken this cow observance. ",
  "mn57:6.7": "I am quite confident that the Buddha ",
  "mn57:6.8": "is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this cow observance, and the naked ascetic Seniya can give up that dog observance.” ",
  "mn57:6.9": "“Well then, Puṇṇa, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn57:6.10": "“Yes, Bhante,” he replied. ",
  "mn57:6.11": "The Buddha said this: ",

  "mn57:7.5": "dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright results; and ",
  "mn57:7.6": "neither-dark-nor-bright action with neither-dark-nor-bright results, which leads to the destruction of action. ",
  "mn57:8.1": "And what is dark action with dark results? ",
  "mn57:8.2": "It’s when someone makes afflictive bodily, verbal, and mental choices. ",
  "mn57:8.3": "Having made these choices, they reappear in an afflictive world ",
  "mn57:8.4": "where they’re touched by afflictive contacts. ",
  "mn57:8.5": "Touched by afflictive contacts, they feel afflictive feelings that are exclusively unpleasant—like the beings in hell. ",
  "mn57:8.6": "This is how what is arises from what was. ",
  "mn57:8.7": "For one reappears according to one’s actions, ",
  "mn57:8.8": "and contacts touch one who has reappeared. ",
  "mn57:8.9": "This is why I say that beings are heirs of their actions. ",
  "mn57:8.10": "These is called dark action with dark results. ",
  "mn57:9.1": "And what is bright action with bright results? ",
  "mn57:9.2": "It’s when someone makes benign bodily, verbal, and mental choices. ",

  "mn57:10.1": "And what is dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright results? ",
  "mn57:10.2": "It’s when someone makes both afflictive and benign choices by way of body, speech, and mind. ",
  "mn57:10.3": "Having made these choices, they are reborn in a world that is both afflictive and benign ",
  "mn57:10.4": "where they’re touched by both afflictive and benign contacts. ",
  "mn57:10.5": "Touched by both afflictive and benign contacts, they feel both afflictive and benign feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and displeasure—like humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld. ",
  "mn57:10.6": "This is how what is arises from what was. ",

  "mn57:12.3": "",
  "mn57:12.4": "From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "mn57:13.1": "And Seniya the naked ascetic who was a dog votary said to the Buddha, ",

  "mn57:14.1": "“Seniya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching-and-discipline, they must spend four months on probation.

  "mn57:14.2": "However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.” ",
  "mn57:14.3": "“Bhante, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into bhikkhuhood.” ",
  "mn57:15.1": "And the naked ascetic Seniya who was a dog votary received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. ",
  "mn57:15.2": "Not long after his ordination, Venerable Seniya, abiding alone, withdrawn, heedful, diligent, and resolute, lived having entered upon the supreme goal of the renunciate life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness, having for himself comprehended and realized it right in the present experience. ",
  "mn57:15.3": "He understood: “Birth is destroyed; the renunciate life has been lived; what had to be done has been done; there will be no more of this.” ",
  "mn57:15.4": "And Venerable Seniya became one of the Arahants. "
