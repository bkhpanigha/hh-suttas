    "mn24:1.1": "Thus have I heard. ",
    "mn24:1.2": "At one time the Auspicious One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
    "mn24:2.1": "Then several bhikkhus who had completed the rainy season residence in their native land went to the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Auspicious One said to them: ",
    "mn24:2.2": "“In your native land, bhikkhus, which of the native bhikkhus is esteemed in this way: ",
    "mn24:2.3": "‘Himself having few wishes, he speaks to the bhikkhus on having few wishes. Himself having contentment, seclusion, aloofness, effort, virtue, composure, understanding, liberation, and the knowledge-and-vision of liberation, he speaks to the bhikkhus on all these things. He is an adviser and instructor, one who educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires his fellow renunciates.’” ",
    "mn24:2.4": "“Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī, venerable sir, is esteemed in this way in our native land.” ",
    "mn24:2.5": " ",
    "mn24:3.1": "Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Auspicious One. ",
    "mn24:3.2": "Then he thought: ",
    "mn24:3.3": "“Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī is fortunate, so very fortunate, ",
    "mn24:3.4": "in that his wise fellow renunciates praise him thoroughly in the presence of the Teacher, and that the Teacher approves. ",
    "mn24:3.5": "Hopefully, some time or other I will get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa, and we can have a discussion.” ",
    "mn24:4.1": "When the Auspicious One had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, he set out for Sāvatthī. ",
    "mn24:4.2": "Traveling stage by stage, he came to Sāvatthī, ",
    "mn24:4.3": "where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
    "mn24:4.4": "Venerable Puṇṇa heard that the Auspicious One had come to Sāvatthī. ",
    "mn24:5.1": "Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī. ",
    "mn24:5.2": "Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He approached the Auspicious One, bowed, and sat down to one side. ",
    "mn24:5.3": "The Auspicious One educated, encouraged, uplifted, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk. ",
    "mn24:5.4": "Then, having delighted in and expressed appreciation for what the Auspicious One said, Puṇṇa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Auspicious One, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Dark Forest for the day’s abiding. ",
    "mn24:6.1": "Then a certain bhikkhu approached Venerable Sāriputta, and said to him, ",
    "mn24:6.2": "“Venerable Sāriputta, the bhikkhu named Puṇṇa, of whom you have often spoken so highly, after being inspired by a talk of the Auspicious One’s, left for the Dark Forest for the day’s abiding.” ",
    "mn24:7.1": "Venerable Sāriputta quickly grabbed his sitting cloth and followed behind Venerable Puṇṇa, keeping sight of his head. ",
    "mn24:7.2": "Venerable Puṇṇa plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding. ",
    "mn24:7.3": "And Venerable Sāriputta did likewise. ",
    "mn24:8.1": "Then, in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Puṇṇa, and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
    "mn24:8.2": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side and said to Venerable Puṇṇa: ",
    "mn24:9.1": "“Venerable, is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One?” ",
    "mn24:9.2": "“Yes, venerable.” ",
    "mn24:9.3": "“So, is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One for the sake of purification of virtue?” ",
    "mn24:9.4": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:9.5": "“Well, is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One for the sake of purification of mind?” ",
    "mn24:9.6": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:9.7": "“Is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One for the sake of purification of view?” ",
    "mn24:9.8": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:9.9": "“Well, is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One for the sake of purification through overcoming doubt?” ",
    "mn24:9.10": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:9.11": "“Is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One for the sake of purification of knowledge-and-vision of what is the path and what is not the path?” ",
    "mn24:9.12": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:9.13": "“Well, is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One for the sake of purification of knowledge-and-vision of the practice?” ",
    "mn24:9.14": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:9.15": "“Is the renunciate life led under the Auspicious One for the sake of purification of knowledge-and-vision?” ",
    "mn24:9.16": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:10.1": "“Venerable, when asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’ ",

    "mn24:10.3": " ",
    "mn24:10.4": " ",
    "mn24:10.5": " ",
    "mn24:10.6": " ",
    "mn24:10.7": " ",
    "mn24:10.8": "Then what exactly is the purpose of leading the renunciate life under the Auspicious One?” ",
    "mn24:10.9": "“The purpose of leading the renunciate life under the Auspicious One is total Nibbāna by non-assumption.” ",
    "mn24:11.1": "“Venerable, is purification of virtue total Nibbāna by non-assumption?” ",
    "mn24:11.2": "“Certainly not, venerable.” ",
    "mn24:11.3": "“Is purification of mind … ",
    "mn24:11.4": " ",
    "mn24:11.5": "purification of view … ",
    "mn24:11.6": " ",
    "mn24:11.7": "purification through overcoming doubt … ",

    "mn24:11.11": "purification of knowledge-and-vision of the practice … ",
    "mn24:11.12": " ",
    "mn24:11.13": "Is purification of knowledge-and-vision total Nibbāna by non-assumption?” ",
    "mn24:11.14": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:11.15": "“Then is there total Nibbāna by non-assumption without these things?” ",
    "mn24:11.16": "“Certainly not.” ",
    "mn24:12.1": "“When asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’ ",
    "mn24:12.2": " ",
    "mn24:12.3": " ",
    "mn24:12.4": " ",
    "mn24:12.5": " ",

    "mn24:12.7": " ",
    "mn24:12.8": " ",
    "mn24:12.9": "How then should we see the meaning of this statement?” ",
    "mn24:13.1": "“Venerable, if the Auspicious One had declared purification of virtue to be total Nibbāna by non-assumption, he would have declared that which has assumption to be total Nibbāna by non-assumption. ",
    "mn24:13.2": "If the Auspicious One had declared purification of mind … ",
    "mn24:13.3": "purification of view … ",
    "mn24:13.4": "purification through overcoming doubt … ",
    "mn24:13.5": "purification of knowledge-and-vision of what is the path and what is not the path … ",
    "mn24:13.6": "purification of knowledge-and-vision of the practice … ",
    "mn24:13.7": "If the Auspicious One had declared purification of knowledge-and-vision to be total Nibbāna by non-assumption, he would have declared that which has assumption to be total Nibbāna by non-assumption. ",
    "mn24:13.8": "But if there were total Nibbāna by non-assumption without these things, an ordinary person would arrive at total Nibbāna. ",
    "mn24:13.9": "For an ordinary person lacks these things. ",
    "mn24:14.1": "So, venerable, I shall give you a simile. ",
    "mn24:14.2": "For by means of a simile some wise men understand the meaning of what is said. ",
    "mn24:14.3": "Suppose that, while staying in Sāvatthī, King Pasenadi of Kosala had some urgent business come up in Sāketa. ",
    "mn24:14.4": "Now, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven chariots were stationed at the ready for him. ",
    "mn24:14.5": "Then Pasenadi, having departed Sāvatthī, mounted the first chariot at the ready by the gate of the royal compound. The first chariot at the ready would bring him to the second, where he would dismount and mount the second chariot. ",
    "mn24:14.6": "The second chariot at the ready would bring him to the third … ",
    "mn24:14.7": "The third chariot at the ready would bring him to the fourth … ",
    "mn24:14.8": "The fourth chariot at the ready would bring him to the fifth … ",
    "mn24:14.9": "The fifth chariot at the ready would bring him to the sixth … ",
    "mn24:14.10": "The sixth chariot at the ready would bring him to the seventh, where he would dismount and mount the seventh chariot. ",
    "mn24:14.11": "The seventh chariot at the ready would bring him to the gate of the royal compound of Sāketa. ",
    "mn24:14.12": "And when he was at the gate, friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would ask him: ",
    "mn24:14.13": "‘Great king, did you come to Sāketa from Sāvatthī by this chariot?’ ",
    "mn24:14.14": "If asked this, how should King Pasenadi rightly reply?” ",
    "mn24:14.15": "“The king should reply: ",
    "mn24:14.16": "‘Well, while staying in Sāvatthī, I had some urgent business come up in Sāketa. ",
    "mn24:14.17": "Now, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven chariots were stationed at the ready for me. ",
    "mn24:14.18": "Then, having departed Sāvatthī, I mounted the first chariot at the ready by the gate of the royal compound. ",
    "mn24:14.19": "The first chariot at the ready brought me to the second, where I dismounted and mounted the second chariot. … ",
    "mn24:14.20": "The second chariot brought me to the third … ",
    "mn24:14.21": "the fourth … ",
    "mn24:14.22": "the fifth … ",
    "mn24:14.23": "the sixth … ",
    "mn24:14.24": "The sixth chariot at the ready brought me to the seventh, where I dismounted and mounted the seventh chariot. ",
    "mn24:14.25": "The seventh chariot at the ready brought me to the gate of the royal compound of Sāketa.’ ",
    "mn24:14.26": "That is how King Pasenadi should rightly reply.” ",
    "mn24:15.1": "“In the same way, venerable, purification of virtue is only for the sake of purification of mind. Purification of mind is only for the sake of purification of view. Purification of view is only for the sake of purification through overcoming doubt. Purification through overcoming doubt is only for the sake of purification of knowledge-and-vision of what is the path and what is not the path. Purification of knowledge-and-vision of what is the path and what is not the path is only for the sake of purification of knowledge-and-vision of the practice. Purification of knowledge-and-vision of the practice is only for the sake of purification of knowledge-and-vision. Purification of knowledge-and-vision is only for the sake of total Nibbāna by non-assumption. ",
    "mn24:15.2": "The renunciate life is led under the Auspicious One for the sake of total Nibbāna by non-assumption.” ",
    "mn24:16.1": "When he said this, Sāriputta said to Puṇṇa, ",
    "mn24:16.2": "“What is the venerable’s name? And how are you known among your fellow renunciates?” ",
    "mn24:16.3": "“Venerable, my name is Puṇṇa. ",
    "mn24:16.4": "And I am known as “son of Mantāṇī” among my fellow renunciates.” ",
    "mn24:16.5": "“It is remarkable, venerable, it is extraordinary! ",
    "mn24:16.6": "Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī has answered each deep question thoroughly, as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teacher’s instructions. ",
    "mn24:16.7": "It is fortunate for his fellow renunciates, so very fortunate, ",
    "mn24:16.8": "that they get to see Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī and associate with him. ",
    "mn24:16.9": "Even if they only got to see him and associate with him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth, it would still be very fortunate for them! And it is fortunate for me, so very fortunate, that I get to see the venerable and associate with him.” ",
    "mn24:17.1": "When he said this, Venerable Puṇṇa said to Venerable Sāriputta, ",
    "mn24:17.2": "“What is the venerable’s name? And how are you known among your fellow renunciates?” ",
    "mn24:17.3": "“Venerable, my name is Upatissa. ",
    "mn24:17.4": "And I am known as Sāriputta among my fellow renunciates.” ",
    "mn24:17.5": "“Goodness! I had no idea I was consulting with the Venerable Sāriputta, the disciple who is fit to be compared with the Teacher himself! ",
    "mn24:17.6": " ",
    "mn24:17.7": "If I had known, I would not have said so much. ",
    "mn24:17.8": "It is remarkable, venerable, it is extraordinary! ",
    "mn24:17.9": "Venerable Sāriputta has asked each deep question thoroughly, as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teacher’s instructions. ",
    "mn24:17.10": "It is fortunate for his fellow renunciates, so very fortunate, ",
    "mn24:17.11": "that they get to see Venerable Sāriputta and associate with him. ",
    "mn24:17.12": "Even if they only got to see him and associate with him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth, it would still be very fortunate for them! And it is fortunate for me, so very fortunate, that I get to see the venerable and associate with him.” ",
    "mn24:17.13": "And so these two spiritual giants appreciated each other’s fine words."
