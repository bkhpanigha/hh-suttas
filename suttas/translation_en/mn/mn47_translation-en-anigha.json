    "mn47:1.4": "“Bhikkhus!” ",
    "mn47:1.5": "“Bhante,” they replied. ",
    "mn47:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
    "mn47:2.1": "“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One to see whether he is a fully awakened Buddha or not.” ",
    "mn47:3.1": "“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Bhante, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The bhikkhus will listen and remember it.” ",

    "mn47:3.3": "“Yes, Bhante,” they replied. ",
    "mn47:3.4": "The Buddha said this: ",
    "mn47:4.1": "“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One for two things—things that can be seen and heard: ",
    "mn47:4.2": "‘Are defiled things that are visible and audible seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’ ",
    "mn47:4.3": "Scrutinizing him, he finds that ",
    "mn47:4.4": "defiled things that are visible and audible are not found in the Realized One. ",

    "mn47:8.3": "‘Are certain perils found in that venerable bhikkhu who has achieved fame and renown?’ ",
    "mn47:8.4": "Bhikkhus, for so long as a bhikkhu has not achieved fame and renown, certain perils are not there for him. ",
    "mn47:8.5": "But when he achieves fame and renown, those perils appear. ",
    "mn47:8.6": "Scrutinizing him, he finds that ",
    "mn47:8.7": "those perils are not there for that venerable bhikkhu who has achieved fame and renown. ",
    "mn47:9.1": "",
    "mn47:9.2": "He scrutinizes further: ",
    "mn47:9.3": "‘Is this venerable restrained without or through fear?” ",
    "mn47:9.4": "Is it because of the destruction of passion, the ending of passion that he does not indulge in sensuality?’ ",
    "mn47:9.5": "Scrutinizing him, he finds that ",
    "mn47:9.6": "that venerable is restrained without fear; he is not restrained through fear. ",
    "mn47:9.7": "It is because of the destruction of passion, the ending of passion that he does not indulge in sensuality. ",
    "mn47:10.1": "If others should ask that bhikkhu, ",
    "mn47:10.2": "‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’ ",
    "mn47:10.3": "",
    "mn47:10.4": "",
    "mn47:10.5": "Answering rightly, the bhikkhu should say, ",

Yet that venerable does not look down on them for that. ",
    "mn47:10.7": "Also, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ",
    "mn47:10.8": "“I am restrained without fear, not through fear. It is because of the destruction of passion, the ending of passion that I do not indulge in sensuality.” ",
    "mn47:11.1": "Next, he should ask the Realized One himself about this, ",
    "mn47:11.2": "‘Are defiled things that are visible and audible seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’ ",

    "mn47:13.4": "I am in the range and territory of those things, but I am not determined by them.’ ",
    "mn47:14.1": "A disciple ought to approach a teacher who has such a doctrine in order to listen to the teaching. ",
    "mn47:14.2": "The teacher explains the teaching with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides. ",
    "mn47:14.3": "When he comprehends a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how they were taught, the bhikkhu comes to a conclusion about the teachings. He gains confidence in the teacher: ",
    "mn47:14.4": "‘The Auspicious One is a fully awakened Buddha! The Dhamma is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!’ ",
    "mn47:15.1": "If others should ask that bhikkhu, ",
    "mn47:15.2": "‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’ ",

    "mn47:15.8": "‘The Auspicious One is a fully awakened Buddha! The Dhamma is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!”’ ",
    "mn47:16.1": "When someone's faith is settled, rooted, and planted in the Realized One in this manner, with these reasons and aspects, it is said to be grounded faith that is based on evidence. ",
  "mn47:16.2": "It is strong, and cannot be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. ",
    "mn47:16.3": "That is how there is legitimate scrutiny of the Realized One, ",
    "mn47:16.4": "and that is how the Realized One is legitimately well-scrutinized.” ",
    "mn47:16.5": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
    "mn47:16.6": "Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Buddha said. "
