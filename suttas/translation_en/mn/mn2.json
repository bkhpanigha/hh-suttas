  "mn2:0.2": "All the Influxes ",
  "mn2:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn2:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn2:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn2:1.4": "“Bhikkhus!” ",
  "mn2:1.5": "“Bhante,” they replied. ",
  "mn2:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn2:2.1": "“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the explanation of the restraint of all influxes. ",
  "mn2:2.2": "Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn2:2.3": "“Yes, Bhante,” they replied. ",
  "mn2:2.4": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn2:3.1": "“Bhikkhus, I say that the exhaustion of the influxes is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see. ",
  "mn2:3.2": "For one who knows and sees what? ",
  "mn2:3.3": "Attention through the origin and attention not through the origin. ",
  "mn2:3.4": "When you attend not through the origin, unarisen influxes arise, and arisen influxes increase. ",
  "mn2:3.5": "When you attend through the origin, unarisen influxes don’t arise, and arisen influxes are given up. ",
  "mn2:4.1": "Some influxes ought to be given up by seeing, some by restraint, some by using, some by bearing, some by avoiding, some by dispelling, and some by developing. ",
  "mn2:5.0": "1. Influxes Given Up by Seeing ",
  "mn2:5.1": "And what are the influxes that should be given up by seeing? ",
  "mn2:5.2": "Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
  "mn2:5.3": "They don’t understand things that should be attended to and things that should not be attended to. ",
  "mn2:5.4": "So they attend to things they shouldn’t and don’t attend to things they should. ",
  "mn2:6.1": "And what are the things which they attend to but shouldn’t? ",
  "mn2:6.2": "They are the things that, when attended to, the unarisen influx of sensuality arises, or the arisen influx of sensuality increases, ",
  "mn2:6.3": "the unarisen influx of being arises, or the arisen influx of being increases, ",
  "mn2:6.4": "being, ",
  "mn2:6.5": "These are the things that they attend to but shouldn’t. ",
  "mn2:6.6": "And what are the things to which they do not attend but should? ",
  "mn2:6.7": "They are the things that, when attended to, the unarisen influx of sensuality does not arise, or the arisen influx of sensuality is given up, ",
  "mn2:6.8": "the unarisen influx of being does not arise, or the arisen influx of being is given up, ",
  "mn2:6.9": "and the unarisen influx of ignorance does not arise, or the arisen influx of ignorance is given up. ",
  "mn2:6.10": "These are the things to which they do not attend but should. ",
  "mn2:7.1": "Because of attending to what they shouldn’t and not attending to what they should, unarisen influxes arise and arisen influxes increase. ",
  "mn2:7.2": "This is how they attend not through the origin: ",
  "mn2:7.3": "‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past? ",
  "mn2:7.4": "Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’ ",
  "mn2:7.5": "Or they are undecided about the present thus: ",
  "mn2:7.6": "‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This creature—where did it come from? And where will it go?’ ",
  "mn2:8.1": "When they attend not through the origin in this way, one of the following six views arises for them: ",
  "mn2:8.2": "The view: ‘There is my self’ arises for them as true and factual. ",
  "mn2:8.3": "The view: ‘There is not my self’ arises for them as true and factual. ",
  "mn2:8.4": "The view: ‘There is not my self.’ ",
  "mn2:8.5": "The view: ‘I perceive not-self with self’ arises for them as true and factual. ",
  "mn2:8.6": "The view: ‘I perceive self with not-self’ arises for them as true and factual. ",
  "mn2:8.7": "Or they have such a view: ",
  "mn2:8.8": "‘This self of mine is he, the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms. This self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’ ",
  "mn2:8.9": "This is called a going into views, a thicket of views, a desert of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. ",
  "mn2:8.10": "Fettered by views, an unlearned ordinary person is not liberated from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, displeasure, sadness, and distress. ",
  "mn2:8.11": "They’re not liberated from suffering, I say. ",
  "mn2:9.1": " ",
  "mn2:9.2": "But take a trained noble disciple who has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
  "mn2:9.3": "They understand things that should be attended to and things that should not be attended to. ",
  "mn2:9.4": "So they attend to things they should and don’t attend to things they shouldn’t. ",
  "mn2:10.1": "And what are the things to which they don’t attend and shouldn’t? ",
  "mn2:10.2": "They are the things that, when attended to, give rise to unarisen influxes, and make arisen influxes grow: the influxes of sensuality, ",
  "mn2:10.3": "being, ",
  "mn2:10.4": "and ignorance. ",
  "mn2:10.5": "These are the things to which they don’t attend and shouldn’t. ",
  "mn2:10.6": "And what are the things to which they do attend and should? ",
  "mn2:10.7": "They are the things that when attended to, do not give rise to unarisen influxes, and give up arisen influxes: the influxes of sensuality, ",
  "mn2:10.8": "being, ",
  "mn2:10.9": "and ignorance. ",
  "mn2:10.10": "These are the things which they do attend and should. ",
  "mn2:10.11": "Because of not attending to what they shouldn’t and attending to what they should, unarisen influxes don’t arise and arisen influxes are given up. ",
  "mn2:11.1": "They attend through the origin: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. ",
  "mn2:11.2": "And as they do so, they give up three fetters: ",
  "mn2:11.3": "personality-view, doubt, and the grasping at virtue-and-duty. ",
  "mn2:11.4": "These are called the influxes that should be given up by seeing. ",
  "mn2:12.0": "2. Influxes Given Up by Restraint ",
  "mn2:12.1": "And what are the influxes that should be given up by restraint? ",
  "mn2:12.2": "Take a bhikkhu who, reflecting through the origin, abides restraining the faculty of the eye. ",
  "mn2:12.3": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint. ",
  "mn2:12.4": "Reflecting through the origin, he abides restraining the faculty of the ear … ",
  "mn2:12.5": "the nose … ",
  "mn2:12.6": "the tongue … ",
  "mn2:12.7": "the body … ",
  "mn2:12.8": "the mind-sense. ",
  "mn2:12.9": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without restraint of the mind-sense faculty do not arise when there is such restraint. ",
  "mn2:12.10": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without restraint do not arise when there is such restraint. ",
  "mn2:12.11": "These are called the influxes that should be given up by restraint. ",
  "mn2:13.0": "3. Influxes Given Up by Using ",
  "mn2:13.1": "And what are the influxes that should be given up by using? ",
  "mn2:13.2": "Take a bhikkhu who, reflecting through the origin, makes use of robes: ",
  "mn2:13.3": "‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’ ",
  "mn2:14.1": "Reflecting through the origin, he makes use of alms-food: ",
  "mn2:14.2": "‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support the renunciate life. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ ",
  "mn2:15.1": "Reflecting through the origin, he makes use of lodgings: ",
  "mn2:15.2": "‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’ ",
  "mn2:16.1": "Reflecting through the origin, he makes use of medicines and supplies for the sick: ",
  "mn2:16.2": "‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’ ",
  "mn2:17.1": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without using these things do not arise when they are used. ",
  "mn2:17.2": "These are called the influxes that should be given up by using. ",
  "mn2:18.0": "4. Influxes Given Up by Bearing ",
  "mn2:18.1": "And what are the influxes that should be given up by bearing? ",
  "mn2:18.2": "Take a bhikkhu who, reflecting through the origin, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. He endures the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. He endures rude and unwelcome criticism. And he puts up with bodily feelings that are painful, sharp, harsh, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. ",
  "mn2:18.3": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without bearing these things do not arise when they are endured. ",
  "mn2:18.4": "These are called the influxes that should be given up by bearing. ",
  "mn2:19.0": "5. Influxes Given Up by Avoiding ",
  "mn2:19.1": "And what are the influxes that should be given up by avoiding? ",
  "mn2:19.2": "Take a bhikkhu who, reflecting through the origin, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer. ",
  "mn2:19.3": "Reflecting through the origin, he avoids sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible fellow renunciates would believe to be a bad setting. ",
  "mn2:19.4": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided. ",
  "mn2:19.5": "These are called the influxes that should be given up by avoiding. ",
  "mn2:20.0": "6. Influxes Given Up by Dispelling ",
  "mn2:20.1": "And what are the influxes that should be given up by dispelling? ",
  "mn2:20.2": "Take a bhikkhu who, reflecting through the origin, doesn’t tolerate sensual, averse, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, drives it out, puts it to an end, and brings it to destruction. He doesn’t tolerate any harmful, unfavorable phenomena that have arisen, but gives them up, drives them out, puts them to an end, and brings them to destruction. ",
  "mn2:20.3": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without dispelling these things do not arise when they are dispelled. ",
  "mn2:20.4": "These are called the influxes that should be given up by dispelling. ",
  "mn2:21.0": "7. Influxes Given Up by Developing ",
  "mn2:21.1": "And what are the influxes that should be given up by developing? ",
  "mn2:21.2": "It’s when a bhikkhu, reflecting through the origin, develops the awakening factors of recollection, ",
  "mn2:21.3": "discernment of phenomena, ",
  "mn2:21.4": "effort, ",
  "mn2:21.5": "joy, ",
  "mn2:21.6": "calm, ",
  "mn2:21.7": "composure, ",
  "mn2:21.8": "and equanimity, which rely on withdrawal, dispassion, and cessation, and ripen in relinquishment. ",
  "mn2:21.9": "For the influxes, trouble, and affliction that might arise in someone who abides without developing these things do not arise when they are developed. ",
  "mn2:21.10": "These are called the influxes that should be given up by developing. ",
  "mn2:22.1": "Now, take a bhikkhu who, by seeing, has given up the influxes that should be given up by seeing. By restraint, he’s given up the influxes that should be given up by restraint. By using, he’s given up the influxes that should be given up by using. By bearing, he’s given up the influxes that should be given up by bearing. By avoiding, he’s given up the influxes that should be given up by avoiding. By dispelling, he’s given up the influxes that should be given up by dispelling. By developing, he’s given up the influxes that should be given up by developing. ",
  "mn2:22.2": "He’s called a bhikkhu who abides having restrained all influxes, who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and with the thorough comprehension of conceit has made an end of suffering.” ",
  "mn2:22.3": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn2:22.4": "Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Buddha said. "
