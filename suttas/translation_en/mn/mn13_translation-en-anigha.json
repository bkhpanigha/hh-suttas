  "mn13:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn13:2.1": "Then several bhikkhus robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. ",
  "mn13:2.2": "Then it occurred to them, ",
  "mn13:2.3": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. ",
  "mn13:2.4": "Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other sects?” ",
  "mn13:2.5": "Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other sects and exchanged pleasantries with the wanderers there. ",
  "mn13:2.6": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: ",
  "mn13:3.1": "“Friends, the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensuality, and so do we. ",
  "mn13:3.2": "The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of form, and so do we. ",
  "mn13:3.3": "The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings, and so do we. ",
  "mn13:3.4": "What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” ",
  "mn13:3.5": " ",
  "mn13:4.1": "Those bhikkhus neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other sects. ",
  "mn13:4.2": "They got up from their seat, thinking, ",
  "mn13:4.3": "“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” ",
  "mn13:5.1": "Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: ",

  "mn13:5.13": " ",
  "mn13:5.14": " ",
  "mn13:6.1": "“Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other sects say this, you should say to them: ",
  "mn13:6.2": "‘But friends, what’s the gratification of sensuality, what is its woe, and what is the escape from it? ",
  "mn13:6.3": "What’s the gratification of form, what is its woe, and what is the escape from it ",
  "mn13:6.4": "What’s the gratification of feelings, what is their woe, and what is the escape from them? ",
  "mn13:6.5": "Questioned like this, the wanderers of other sects would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. ",
  "mn13:6.6": "Why is that? ",
  "mn13:6.7": "Because they’re out of their element. ",
  "mn13:6.8": "I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. ",
  "mn13:7.1": "And what is the gratification of sensuality? ",
  "mn13:7.2": "There are these five strands of sensuality. ",
  "mn13:7.3": "What five? ",
  "mn13:7.4": "forms known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. ",
  "mn13:7.5": "Sounds cognizable by the ear … ",
  "mn13:7.6": "Smells cognizable by the nose … ",
  "mn13:7.7": "Tastes cognizable by the tongue … ",
  "mn13:7.8": "Touches cognizable by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. ",
  "mn13:7.9": "These are the five strands of sensuality. ",
  "mn13:7.10": "The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five strands of sensuality: this is the gratification of sensuality. ",
  "mn13:8.1": "And what is the woe in sensuality? ",
  "mn13:8.2": "It’s when a clansman earns a living by means such as ",
  "mn13:8.3": "arithmetic, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. ",
  "mn13:8.4": "But he must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst. ",
  "mn13:8.5": "This is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn13:9.1": "That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to earn any money. ",
  "mn13:9.2": "If this happens, he sorrows and wails and laments, beating his breast and becoming muddled, saying: ",
  "mn13:9.3": "‘Oh, my hard work is wasted. My efforts are fruitless!’ ",
  "mn13:9.4": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn13:10.1": "That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, and succeed in earning money. ",
  "mn13:10.2": "But he experiences suffering and sadness when he tries to protect it, thinking: ",
  "mn13:10.3": "‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ ",
  "mn13:10.4": "And even though he protect its and wards it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. ",
  "mn13:10.5": "He sorrows and wails and laments, beating his breast and becoming muddled: ",
  "mn13:10.6": "‘What once was mine is gone.’ ",
  "mn13:10.7": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn13:11.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend. ",
  "mn13:11.2": "Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords, ",
  "mn13:11.3": "resulting in death and deadly suffering. ",
  "mn13:11.4": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn13:12.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and plunge into a battle massed on both sides, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. ",
  "mn13:12.2": "There they are struck with arrows and spears, and their heads are chopped off, ",
  "mn13:12.3": "resulting in death and deadly suffering. ",

  "mn13:13.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and charge wetly plastered bastions, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. ",
  "mn13:13.2": "There they are struck with arrows and spears, splashed with dung, crushed by a superior force, and their heads are chopped off, ",
  "mn13:13.3": "resulting in death and deadly suffering. ",
  "mn13:13.4": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn13:14.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality they break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery. ",
  "mn13:14.2": "The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments— ",
  "mn13:14.3": "whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.

  "mn13:14.4": "These result in death and deadly suffering. ",
  "mn13:14.5": "This too is a woe in sensuality that’s presently evident, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",

  "mn13:15.2": "When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",
  "mn13:15.3": "This is a woe in sensuality to do with what comes later, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
  "mn13:16.1": "And what is the escape from sensuality? ",
  "mn13:16.2": "Removing and giving up desire-and-passion for sensuality: this is the escape from sensuality. ",
  "mn13:17.1": "That any ascetics or brahmins who don’t understand as they are the gratification, woe, and escape from sensuality in this way will themselves completely understand sensuality, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand sensuality—that is impossible. ",
  "mn13:17.2": "And that any ascetics or brahmins who do understand as they are the gratification, woe, and escape from sensuality in this way will themselves completely understand sensuality, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand sensuality—that is possible.

  "mn13:18.1": "And what is the gratification of form? ",
  "mn13:18.2": "Suppose there was a girl of the brahmins, aristocrats, or householders in her fifteenth or sixteenth year, neither too tall nor too short, neither too thin nor too fat, neither too dark nor too fair. Is she not at the height of her beauty and prettiness?” ",
  "mn13:18.3": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn13:18.4": "“The pleasure and happiness that arise from this beauty and prettiness ",
  "mn13:18.5": "is the gratification of form. ",
  "mn13:19.1": "And what is the woe in form? ",
  "mn13:19.2": "Suppose that some time later you were to see that same lady—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy. ",
  "mn13:19.3": "What do you think, bhikkhus? ",
  "mn13:19.4": "Has not that former beauty vanished and the woe become clear?” ",
  "mn13:19.5": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn13:19.6": "“This is the woe in form. ",

  "mn13:23-28.3": "bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull. … ",

  "mn13:32.3": "At that time a bhikkhu doesn’t intend to for his own affliction, for that of others, or for that of both; ",
