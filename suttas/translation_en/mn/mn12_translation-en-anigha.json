He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended.

They found fault with the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These beings, however, engaged in good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They did not find fault with the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.

  "mn12:45.1": "And this is what my fervent asceticism was like. I went naked, ignoring conventions. I licked my hands, and did not come or stop when asked. I did not consent to food brought to me, or food prepared specially for me, or an invitation for a meal.",
  "mn12:45.2": "I did not receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where food for distribution is advertised; or where there is a dog waiting or flies buzzing. I accepted no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drank no beer.",
  "mn12:45.3": "I went to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.",
  "mn12:45.4": "I fed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.",
  "mn12:45.5": "I ate once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. I lived committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.",
  "mn12:45.6": "I ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. I survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.",
  "mn12:45.7": "I wore robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.",
  "mn12:45.8": "I tore out hair and beard, committed to this practice.",
  "mn12:45.9": "I constantly stood, refusing seats.",
  "mn12:45.10": "I squatted, committed to the endeavor of squatting.",
  "mn12:45.11": "I lay on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns my bed.",
  "mn12:45.12": "I was committed to the practice of immersing in water three times a day, including the evening.",
  "mn12:45.13": "And so I lived committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.",
  "mn12:45.14": "Such was my practice of fervent mortification.",
  "mn12:46.1": "And this is what my rough living was like.",
  "mn12:46.2": "The dust and dirt built up on my body over many years until it started flaking off.",
  "mn12:46.3": "It is like the trunk of a pale-moon ebony tree, which builds up bark over many years until it starts flaking off.",
  "mn12:46.4": "But it did not occur to me:",
  "mn12:46.5": "‘Oh, if only this dust and dirt were rubbed off by my hand or someone else’s!’ ",
  "mn12:46.6": "That did not occur to me. ",
  "mn12:46.7": "Such was my rough living. ",
  "mn12:47.1": "And this is what my shunning was like. ",
  "mn12:47.2": "I would step forward or back with great care; my kindness was established for even a drop of water, thinking: ",
  "mn12:47.3": "‘May I not injure any little creatures on unclear ground.’ ",
  "mn12:47.4": "Such was my shunning. ",
  "mn12:48.1": "And this is what my seclusion was like. ",
  "mn12:48.2": "I would plunge deep into a wilderness region and stay there. ",
  "mn12:48.3": "When I saw a cowherd or a shepherd, or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a lumberjack, I would flee from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from valley to valley, from uplands to uplands. ",
  "mn12:48.4": "Why is that? ",
  "mn12:48.5": "So that I would not see them, nor they me. ",
  "mn12:48.6": "I fled like a wild deer seeing a human being. ",
  "mn12:48.7": " ",
  "mn12:48.8": " ",
  "mn12:48.9": " ",
  "mn12:48.10": "Such was my practice of seclusion. ",
  "mn12:49.1": "I would go on all fours into the cow-pens after the cattle had left and eat the dung of the young suckling calves. ",
  "mn12:49.2": "As long as my own urine and excrement lasted, I would even eat that. ",
  "mn12:49.3": "Such was my eating of most gruesome things. ",
  "mn12:50.1": "I would plunge deep into a frightening forest grove and stay there. ",
  "mn12:50.2": "It was so frightening that ",
  "mn12:50.3": "normally it would make the hairs of whoever were not free from passion stand up if they entered it. ",
  "mn12:50.4": "And on days such as the cold spell when the snow falls in the January winter, I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by day. ",
  "mn12:50.5": "But in the last month of summer I would stay in the open by day and in the forest by night. ",
  "mn12:50.6": "And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me: ",
  "mn12:50.7": "‘Scorched and frozen, ",
  "mn12:50.8": "alone in the frightening forest. ",
  "mn12:50.9": "Naked, no fire to sit beside, ",
  "mn12:50.10": "the sage still pursues his quest.’ ",
  "mn12:51.1": "I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow. ",
  "mn12:51.2": "Then village louts would come up to me. They would spit and urinate on me, throw mud on me, even poke sticks in my ears. ",
  "mn12:51.3": "But I do not recall ever having an evil intent towards them. ",
  "mn12:51.4": "Such was my abiding in equanimity. ",
  "mn12:52.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ",
  "mn12:52.2": "‘Purity comes from food.’ ",
  "mn12:52.3": "They say: ",
  "mn12:52.4": "‘Let us live on jujubes.’ ",
  "mn12:52.5": "So they eat jujubes and jujube powder, and drink jujube juice. ",
  "mn12:52.6": "And they enjoy many jujube concoctions. ",
  "mn12:52.7": "I recall eating just a single jujube. ",
  "mn12:52.8": "You might think that ",
  "mn12:52.9": "at that time the jujubes must have been very big. ",
  "mn12:52.10": "But you should not see it like this.",
  "mn12:52.11": "The jujubes then were at most the same size as today.",
  "mn12:52.12": "Eating so very little, my body became extremely emaciated.",
  "mn12:52.13": "Due to eating so little, my limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a corpse,",
  "mn12:52.14": "my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,",
  "mn12:52.15": "my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,",
  "mn12:52.16": "and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.",
  "mn12:52.17": "Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.",
  "mn12:52.18": "Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.",
  "mn12:52.19": "Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.",
  "mn12:52.20": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.",
  "mn12:52.21": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.",
