  "mn38:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn38:2.1": "Now at that time a bhikkhu called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following pernicious view: ",
  "mn38:2.2": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” ",
  "mn38:3.1": "Several bhikkhus heard about this. ",

  "mn38:3.7": "“Absolutely, friends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” ",
  "mn38:3.8": "Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the bhikkhus pursued, pressed, and grilled him, ",
  "mn38:3.9": "“Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. ",
  "mn38:3.10": "In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently arisen, since without a support, consciousness cannot exist.” ",
  "mn38:3.11": "But even though the bhikkhus pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his pernicious view and insisted on it. ",
  "mn38:3.12": "",
  "mn38:4.1": "When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the bhikkhus went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

  "mn38:5.1": "So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, ",

  "mn38:5.4": "“Yes, Bhante,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti and said to him, ",

  "mn38:5.8": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?” ",
  "mn38:5.9": "“Absolutely, Bhante. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” ",
  "mn38:5.10": "“Sāti, what is that consciousness?” ",
  "mn38:5.11": "“Bhante, he is the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad actions in all the different realms.” ",
  "mn38:5.12": "“Inept man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way? ",
  "mn38:5.13": "Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently arisen, since without a support, consciousness cannot exist? ",
  "mn38:5.14": "But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and create much wickedness. ",
  "mn38:5.15": "This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.” ",

  "mn38:6.4": "“How could that be, Bhante? ",
  "mn38:6.5": "No, Bhante.” ",
  "mn38:6.6": "When this was said, Sāti sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. ",

  "mn38:6.8": "“Inept man, you will be known by your own pernicious view. ",
  "mn38:6.9": "I’ll question the bhikkhus about this.” ",
  "mn38:7.1": "Then the Buddha said to the bhikkhus, ",

  "mn38:7.3": "“No, Bhante. ",
