  "mn20:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn20:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn20:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn20:1.4": "“Bhikkhus!” ",
  "mn20:1.5": "“Bhante,” they replied. ",
  "mn20:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn20:2.1": "“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu committed to the higher mind should attend to five signs from time to time. ",
  "mn20:2.2": "What five? ",
  "mn20:3.1": "Take a bhikkhu who is attending to some sign due to which bad, unbeneficial thoughts connected with desire, ill will, and muddledness are arising. That bhikkhu should attend to a different sign connected with the beneficial. ",
  "mn20:3.2": "As he does so, those bad, unbeneficial thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:3.3": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established, settled, unified, and composed internally. ",
  "mn20:3.4": "It’s like a deft carpenter or their apprentice who’d knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg. ",
  "mn20:3.5": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … should attend to a different sign connected with the beneficial … ",
  "mn20:3.6": " ",
  "mn20:3.7": " ",
  "mn20:4.1": "Now, suppose that despite the bhikkhu attending to a different sign connected with the beneficial, bad, unbeneficial thoughts connected with desire, ill will, and muddledness still arise. He should consider the danger of those thoughts: ",
  "mn20:4.2": "‘So these thoughts are unbeneficial, they’re blameworthy, and they result in suffering.’ ",
  "mn20:4.3": "As he does so, those bad, unbeneficial thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:4.4": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established, settled, unified, and composed internally. ",
  "mn20:4.5": "Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted. ",
  "mn20:4.6": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … should consider the peril of those thoughts … ",
  "mn20:4.7": " ",
  "mn20:4.8": " ",
  "mn20:4.9": " ",
  "mn20:5.1": "Now, suppose that despite the bhikkhu considering the peril of those thoughts, bad, unbeneficial thoughts connected with desire, ill will, and muddledness still arise. He should forget them and not pay attention to them. ",
  "mn20:5.2": "As he does so, those bad, unbeneficial thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:5.3": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established, settled, unified, and composed internally. ",
  "mn20:5.4": "Suppose there was a man with good eyesight, and some undesirable forms came into range. ",
  "mn20:5.5": "He’d just close their eyes or look away. ",
  "mn20:5.6": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … those harmful thoughts are given up and come to an end … ",
  "mn20:5.7": " ",
  "mn20:6.1": "Now, suppose that despite the bhikkhu ignoring and not paying attention to those thoughts, bad, unbeneficial thoughts connected with desire, ill will, and muddledness still arise. He should direct his mind to settling the thought-activity. ",
  "mn20:6.2": "As he does so, those bad, unbeneficial thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:6.3": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established, settled, unified, and composed internally. ",
  "mn20:6.4": "Suppose there was a man walking quickly. ",
  "mn20:6.5": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.6": "‘Why am I walking quickly? ",
  "mn20:6.7": "Why don’t I slow down?’ ",
  "mn20:6.8": "So they’d slow down. ",
  "mn20:6.9": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.10": "‘Why am I walking slowly? ",
  "mn20:6.11": "Why don’t I stand still?’ ",
  "mn20:6.12": "So they’d stand still. ",
  "mn20:6.13": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.14": "‘Why am I standing still? ",
  "mn20:6.15": "Why don’t I sit down?’ ",
  "mn20:6.16": "So they’d sit down. ",
  "mn20:6.17": "He’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.18": "‘Why am I sitting? ",
  "mn20:6.19": "Why don’t I lie down?’ ",
  "mn20:6.20": "So they’d lie down. ",
  "mn20:6.21": "And so that person would reject successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones. ",
  "mn20:6.22": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … those thoughts are given up and subside … ",
  "mn20:6.23": " ",
  "mn20:7.1": "Now, suppose that despite the bhikkhu directing his mind to settling the thought-activity, bad, unbeneficial thoughts connected with desire, ill will, and muddledness still arise. ",
  "mn20:7.2": "With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, he should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. ",
  "mn20:7.3": "As he does so, those bad, unbeneficial thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:7.4": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established, settled, unified, and composed internally. ",
  "mn20:7.5": "It’s like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them. ",
  "mn20:7.6": "In the same way, a bhikkhu … ",
  "mn20:7.7": "with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. ",
  "mn20:7.8": "As he does so, those bad, unbeneficial thoughts are given up, and they subside. ",
  "mn20:7.9": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established, settled, unified, and composed internally. ",
  "mn20:8.1": "When a bhikkhu who is attending to some sign due to which bad, unbeneficial thoughts connected with desire, ill will, and muddledness are arising attends to a different sign connected with the beneficial … ",
  "mn20:8.2": " ",
  "mn20:8.3": "… considers the peril of those thoughts … ",
  "mn20:8.4": " ",

  "mn20:8.10": "With their abandoning, his mind becomes established, settled, unified, and composed internally. ",
  "mn20:8.11": "This is called a bhikkhu who is a master of the ways and modes of thought. ",
  "mn20:8.12": "He will think what he wants to think, and he won’t think what he doesn’t want to think. ",
  "mn20:8.13": "He’s cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.” ",
  "mn20:8.14": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn20:8.15": " Pleased, the bhikkhus delighted in what the Buddha said. ",
