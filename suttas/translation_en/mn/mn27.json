    "mn27:4.13": "They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer? ",
    "mn27:4.14": "Invariably, they become his disciples. ",
    "mn27:4.15": "When I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion, ",

    "mn27:7.14": "They say, ",
    "mn27:7.15": "‘We were almost lost! We almost perished! ",
    "mn27:7.16": "For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and Arahants, but we were none of these things. ",

    "mn27:8.1": "When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms towards the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: ",
