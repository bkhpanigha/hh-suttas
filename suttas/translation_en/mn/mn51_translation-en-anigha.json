  "mn51:7.10": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn51:8.1": "“And what individual mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves? It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared for them, or an invitation for a meal. ",
  "mn51:8.2": "They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. ",

  "mn51:8.12": "They’re committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening. ",
  "mn51:8.13": "And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. ",
  "mn51:8.14": "This is called an individual who mortifies themselves, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves. ",
  "mn51:9.1": "And what individual mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others? ",
  "mn51:9.2": "It’s when an individual is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, or poultry, a hunter or trapper, a fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher, a jailer, or someone with some other kind of cruel livelihood. ",
  "mn51:9.3": "This is called an individual who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others. ",
  "mn51:10.1": "And what individual mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others? ",

  "mn51:10.5": "The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder. ",
  "mn51:10.6": "He says: ",

  "mn51:10.8": "His bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. ",
  "mn51:10.9": "This is called an individual who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others. ",
  "mn51:11.1": "And what individual doesn’t mortify neither themselves or others, but lives desireless right in the present experience, extinguished, cooled, experiencing comfort, having themselves become divine? ",
  "mn51:12.1": "It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. ",
  "mn51:12.2": "Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—he makes it known to others. ",

  "mn51:13.2": "They gain faith in the Realized One ",
  "mn51:13.3": "and reflect: ",
  "mn51:13.4": "‘Household life is confined and dusty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. ",
  "mn51:13.5": "It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the renunciate life utterly complete and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "mn51:13.6": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "mn51:13.7": "After some time he gives up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. He shaves off hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn51:14.1": "Once he’s gone forth, he takes up the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus. He gives up and abstains from killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. He’s scrupulous and kind, living compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings. ",
  "mn51:14.2": "He gives up and abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what’s given, and expects only what’s given. He keeps himself clean by not thieving. ",

  "mn51:14.5": "He gives up and abstains from divisive speech. He doesn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, enjoying harmony, and speaking words that promote harmony. ",
  "mn51:14.6": "He gives up and abstains from harsh speech. He speaks in a way that’s gentle, pleasing to the ear, affectionate, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. ",
  "mn51:14.7": "He gives up and abstains from frivolous speech. His words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and discipline. He says things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. ",
  "mn51:14.8": "He abstains from violence towards plants and seeds. ",

  "mn51:18.1": "Possessed of this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble recollection-and-awareness, ",
  "mn51:18.2": "he frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. ",

That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I reappeared somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and displeasure, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I reappeared here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details. ",

  "mn51:25.2": "With the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how beings reappear according to their actions. ‘These beings engaged in misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They found fault with the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These beings, however, engaged in good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought. They did not find fault with the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they reappear in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with the divine eye that is purified and superhuman, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how beings reappear according to their actions. ",
