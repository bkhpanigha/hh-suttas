  "mn40:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town named Assapura. ",
  "mn40:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn40:1.4": "“Bhikkhus!” ",
  "mn40:1.5": "“Bhante,” they replied. ",
  "mn40:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn40:2.1": "“Bhikkhus, people label you as ascetics. ",
  "mn40:2.2": "And when they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics. ",
  "mn40:2.3": "Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will enter upon the way that is proper for an ascetic. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct. ",

  "mn40:2.5": "",
  "mn40:2.6": "Any robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’ ",
  "mn40:2.7": "",

  "mn40:3.3": "These stains, defects, and dregs of an ascetic lead to places of loss, and are to be experienced in bad destinations. As long as they have not given these up, they have not entered upon the way that is proper for an ascetic, I say. ",
  "mn40:4.1": "I say that such a bhikkhu’s going forth may be compared to the kind of weapon called ‘deadborn’—double-edged, whetted with yellow arsenic—that has been covered and wrapped in an outer robe. ",

  "mn40:6.3": "But sometimes I see someone with these qualities who wears an outer robe. That’s why I don’t say that someone is an ascetic just because they wear an outer robe. ",

  "mn40:7.1": "And how has a bhikkhu entered upon the way that is proper for an ascetic? ",
  "mn40:7.2": "There are some bhikkhus who have given up covetousness, ill will, irritability, hostility, denigration, contentiousness, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, evil wishes, and wrong view. ",
  "mn40:7.3": "Since they have given up these stains, defects, and dregs of an ascetic that lead to places of loss and are to be experienced in bad destinations, they have entered upon the way that is proper for an ascetic, I say. ",

  "mn40:8.2": "Considering this, gladness is born. When he’s glad, joy is born. When the mind is joyous, the body becomes calm. When the body is calm, he feels comfort. When he’s comfortable, the mind becomes composed. ",
  "mn40:9.1": "He abides having pervaded with a mind of friendliness the first direction, likewise second, likewise third, likewise the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will. ",

  "mn40:10-12.3": "He abides having pervaded with a mind of equanimity the first direction, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, he abides having pervaded the whole world with a mind of equanimity—abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free of enmity and ill will. ",
  "mn40:13.1": "Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. ",

  "mn40:13.3": "No matter what direction they come from, when they arrive at that lotus pond they would alleviate their thirst and heat destruction. ",
  "mn40:13.4": "In the same way, suppose someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness—whether from a family of aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, or menials—and has arrived at the teaching-and-discipline proclaimed by a Realized One.
