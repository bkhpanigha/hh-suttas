  "mn22:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn22:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn22:2.1": "Now at that time a bhikkhu called Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful view: ",
  "mn22:2.2": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” ",
  "mn22:2.3": "Several bhikkhus heard about this. ",
  "mn22:2.4": " ",
  "mn22:2.5": " ",
  "mn22:3.1": "They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him, ",
  "mn22:3.2": "“Is it really true, Friend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful view: ",
  "mn22:3.3": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?” ",
  "mn22:3.4": "“Absolutely, friends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” ",
  "mn22:3.5": "Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the bhikkhus pursued, pressed, and grilled him, ",
  "mn22:3.6": "“Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. ",
  "mn22:3.7": "In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them. ",
  "mn22:3.8": "The Buddha says that sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the danger in it is what's greater. ",
  "mn22:3.9": "With the similes of a skeleton … ",
  "mn22:3.10": "a scrap of meat … ",
  "mn22:3.11": "a grass torch … ",
  "mn22:3.12": "a pit of glowing coals … ",

  "mn22:3.18": "a snake’s head, the Buddha says that sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the danger in it is what's greater.” ",
  "mn22:3.19": "But even though the bhikkhus pursued, pressed, and grilled him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his view and insisted on stating it. ",
  "mn22:3.20": "When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the bhikkhus went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

  "mn22:5.1": "So the Buddha addressed one of the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn22:5.2": "“Please, bhikkhu, in my name tell the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture trapper, that ",
  "mn22:5.3": "the teacher summons him.” ",
  "mn22:5.4": "“Yes, Bhante,” that bhikkhu replied. He went to Ariṭṭha and said to him, ",
  "mn22:5.5": "“Friend Ariṭṭha, the teacher summons you.” ",
  "mn22:5.6": "“Yes, friend,” Ariṭṭha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn22:5.7": "“Is it really true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful view: ",
  "mn22:5.8": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?” ",
  "mn22:5.9": "“Absolutely, Bhante. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” ",
  "mn22:6.1": "“Inept man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way? ",
  "mn22:6.2": "Haven’t I said in many ways that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them? ",
  "mn22:6.3": "I’ve said that sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the danger in it is what's greater. ",
  "mn22:6.4": "With the similes of a skeleton … ",
  "mn22:6.5": "a scrap of meat … ",

  "mn22:6.13": "a snake’s head, I’ve said that sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the danger in it is what's greater. ",
  "mn22:6.14": "But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and create much demerit. ",
  "mn22:6.15": "This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.” ",
  "mn22:7.1": "Then the Buddha said to the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn22:7.2": "“What do you think, bhikkhus? ",
  "mn22:7.3": "Is this bhikkhu Ariṭṭha even warmed up in this teaching and training?” ",
  "mn22:7.4": "“How could that be? ",
  "mn22:7.5": "No, Bhante.” ",
  "mn22:7.6": "When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. ",
  "mn22:7.7": "Knowing this, the Buddha said, ",
  "mn22:7.8": "“Inept man, you will be known by your own harmful view. ",
  "mn22:7.9": "I’ll question the bhikkhus about this.” ",
  "mn22:8.1": "Then the Buddha said to the bhikkhus, ",
  "mn22:8.2": "“Bhikkhus, do you understand my teaching as Ariṭṭha does, when he misrepresents me by his own wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much demerit?” ",
  "mn22:8.3": "“No, Bhante. ",
  "mn22:8.4": "For in many ways the Buddha has told us that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them. ",
  "mn22:8.5": " ",
  "mn22:8.6": "The Buddha has said that sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the danger in it is what's greater. ",

  "mn22:8.15": "This will be for his lasting harm and suffering. ",
  "mn22:9.1": "Truly, bhikkhus, it is quite impossible to engage in sensual acts without sense desire, and without perceptions and thoughts of sensuality. ",
  "mn22:10.1": "Take a foolish person who memorizes the teaching— ",
  "mn22:10.2": "statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, sayings, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and questions-and-answers. ",
  "mn22:10.3": "But they don’t consider the meaning of those teachings with understanding, ",

  "mn22:10.6": "They don’t realize the goal for which they memorized them. ",
  "mn22:10.7": "Because they’re wrongly grasped, those teachings lead to their lasting harm and suffering. ",
  "mn22:10.8": "Why is that? ",

  "mn22:10.10": "Suppose there was a person in need of a venomous snake. And while wandering in search of a venomous snake ",

  "mn22:10.12": "and grasp it by the coil or the tail. ",
  "mn22:10.13": "But that venomous snake would twist back and bite them on the hand or the arm or limb, ",
  "mn22:10.14": "resulting in dead or deadly suffering. ",
  "mn22:10.15": "Why is that? ",
  "mn22:10.16": "Because of their wrong grasp of the venomous snake. ",

  "mn22:11.3": "And once he’s memorized them, he considers their meaning with understanding, ",

  "mn22:11.10": "Suppose there was a person in need of a venomous snake. And while wandering in search of a venomous snake ",
  "mn22:11.11": "they’d see a big venomous snake, ",
  "mn22:11.12": "and hold it down carefully with a cleft stick. ",
  "mn22:11.13": "Only then would they correctly grasp it by the neck. ",
  "mn22:11.14": "And even though that venomous snake might wrap its coils around that person’s hand or arm or some other limb, that wouldn’t result in death or deadly suffering. ",
  "mn22:11.15": "Why is that? ",
  "mn22:11.16": "Because of their correct grasp of the venomous snake. ",

  "mn22:12.1": "So, bhikkhus, when you understand what I’ve said, you should remember it accordingly. ",
  "mn22:12.2": "But if I’ve said anything that you don’t understand, you should ask me about it, or some competent bhikkhus. ",
  "mn22:13.1": "Bhikkhus, I will teach you a simile of the Dhamma as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on. ",
  "mn22:13.2": "Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn22:13.3": "“Yes, Bhante,” they replied. ",
  "mn22:13.4": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn22:13.5": "“Suppose there was a person traveling along the road. ",
  "mn22:13.6": "They’d see a large body of water, whose near shore was dubious and perilous, while the far shore was a sanctuary free of peril. ",
  "mn22:13.7": "But there was no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over. ",
  "mn22:13.8": "They’d think, ",
  "mn22:13.9": " ",
  "mn22:13.10": " ",
  "mn22:13.11": "‘Why don’t I gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves and make a raft? Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.’ ",
  "mn22:13.12": "And so they’d do exactly that. ",
  "mn22:13.13": "And when they’d crossed over to the far shore, they’d think, ",
  "mn22:13.14": "‘This raft has been very helpful to me. ",
  "mn22:13.15": "Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I have safely crossed over to the far shore. ",
  "mn22:13.16": "Why don’t I hoist it on my head or pick it up on my shoulder and go wherever I want?’ ",
  "mn22:13.17": "What do you think, bhikkhus? ",
  "mn22:13.18": "Would that person be doing what should be done with that raft?” ",
  "mn22:13.19": "“No, Bhante.” ",
  "mn22:13.20": "“And what, bhikkhus, should that person do with the raft? ",
  "mn22:13.21": "When they’d crossed over they should think, ",
  "mn22:13.22": "‘This raft has been very helpful to me. … ",
  "mn22:13.23": " ",
  "mn22:13.24": "Why don’t I beach it on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go wherever I want?’ ",
  "mn22:13.25": "That’s what that person should do with the raft. ",
  "mn22:13.26": "In the same way, the Dhamma has been taught by me similar to a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on. ",
  "mn22:14.1": "By understanding the simile of the raft, you will even give up the teachings, let alone what is against the teachings. ",
  "mn22:15.1": "Bhikkhus, there are these six grounds for views. ",
  "mn22:15.2": "What six? ",
  "mn22:15.3": "Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
  "mn22:15.4": "They regard form as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ ",
  "mn22:15.5": "They also regard feeling … ",

  "mn22:15.9": "And as for this ground for views: ",
  "mn22:15.10": "‘The world and the self are one and the same. After death I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’ ",
  "mn22:15.11": "They regard this also as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ ",
  "mn22:16.1": "But a trained noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",

  "mn22:17.1": "Seeing in this way, they’re not anxious about what isn't there.” ",
  "mn22:18.1": "When he said this, one of the bhikkhus asked the Buddha, ",
