  "sn36.6:1.2": "A learned noble disciple also feels pleasant, unpleasant, and neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feelings. ",
  "sn36.6:1.3": "What, then, is the distinction, disparity, and difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person?” ",
  "sn36.6:1.4": "Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” ",
  "sn36.6:1.5": "An unlearned ordinary person, when struck by unpleasant feeling, sorrows, wails, laments, beats their breast, and falls into a muddle. ",
  "sn36.6:1.6": "They feel two feelings: ",
  "sn36.6:1.7": "one bodily and one pertaining to the <em>citta</em>. ",
  "sn36.6:1.8": "It’s like someone who is pierced by an arrow, ",
