  "sn22.81:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. ",
  "sn22.81:1.2": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms. ",
  "sn22.81:1.3": "After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the bhikkhu Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion. ",
  "sn22.81:2.1": "Then, not long after the Buddha had left, one of the bhikkhus went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what had happened. ",
  "sn22.81:2.2": "",
  "sn22.81:2.3": "Venerable Ānanda said, “Friend, when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone. ",
  "sn22.81:2.4": "At this time no-one should follow him.” ",
  "sn22.81:3.1": "Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage, arrived at Pārileyya, ",
  "sn22.81:3.2": "where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree. ",
  "sn22.81:3.3": "Then several bhikkhus went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
  "sn22.81:3.4": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, they sat down to one side and said to him, ",
  "sn22.81:3.5": "“Friend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. ",
  "sn22.81:3.6": "We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” ",
  "sn22.81:4.1": "Then Venerable Ānanda together with those bhikkhus went to Pārileyya to see the Buddha. They bowed and sat down to one side, ",
  "sn22.81:4.2": "and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. ",
  "sn22.81:4.3": "Now at that time one of the bhikkhus had the thought, ",
  "sn22.81:4.4": "“For one who knows and sees in which way is there immediately the exhaustion of the influxes?” ",
  "sn22.81:4.5": "Then the Buddha, knowing what that bhikkhu was thinking, addressed the bhikkhus: ",
  "sn22.81:4.6": "“Bhikkhus, I’ve explained the Dhamma thoroughly. ",
  "sn22.81:4.7": "I’ve thoroughly explained the four establishments of recollection, ",

  "sn22.81:4.15": "Though I’ve explained the Dhamma thoroughly like this, still a certain bhikkhu present here has this thought: ",
  "sn22.81:4.16": "“For one who knows and sees in which way is there immediately the exhaustion of the influxes?” ",
  "sn22.81:5.1": "And for one who knows and sees in which way, bhikkhus, is there the exhaustion of the influxes? ",
  "sn22.81:5.2": "Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
  "sn22.81:5.3": "They regard form as self. ",
