  "dn10:0.2": "With Subha ",
  "dn10:1.1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "dn10:1.1.2": "At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully extinguished. ",
  "dn10:1.1.3": "Now at that time the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī on some business. ",
  "dn10:1.2.1": "Then he addressed a certain student, ",
  "dn10:1.2.2": "“Here, student, go to the ascetic Ānanda and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",
  "dn10:1.2.4": "And then say: ",
  "dn10:1.3.1": "‘Sir, please visit the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, at his home out of compassion.’” ",
  "dn10:1.3.2": "“Yes, sir,” replied the student, and did as he was asked. ",
  "dn10:1.4.1": "When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to him, ",
  "dn10:1.4.2": "“It’s not the right time, student. ",
  "dn10:1.4.3": "I have drunk a dose of medicine today. ",
  "dn10:1.4.4": "But hopefully tomorrow I’ll get a chance to visit him.” ",
  "dn10:1.4.5": "“Yes, sir,” replied the student. He went back to Subha, and told him what had happened, adding, ",
  "dn10:1.4.13": "“This much, sir, I managed to do. At least Master Ānanda will take the opportunity to visit tomorrow.” ",
  "dn10:1.5.1": "Then when the night had passed, Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Cetaka as his second monk to Subha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Subha went up to Ānanda, and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
  "dn10:1.5.2": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda: ",
  "dn10:1.5.3": "“Master Ānanda, you were Master Gotama’s attendant. You were close to him, living in his presence. ",
  "dn10:1.5.4": "You ought to know what things Master Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people. ",
  "dn10:1.5.5": "What were those things?” ",
  "dn10:1.6.1": "“Student, the Buddha praised three aggregates, and that’s what he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people in. ",
  "dn10:1.6.2": "What three? ",
  "dn10:1.6.3": "The noble aggregate of virtue, the noble aggregate of composure, and the noble aggregate of understanding. ",
  "dn10:1.6.4": "These are the three aggregates that the Buddha praised, and in which he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people.” ",
  "dn10:1.6.5.0": "1. The Aggregate of Virtue ",
  "dn10:1.6.6": "“But what was that aggregate of noble virtue that the Buddha praised?” ",
  "dn10:1.7.1": "“Student, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. ",
  "dn10:1.7.2": "Having for himself comprehended and experienced this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—he makes it known to others. ",
  "dn10:1.7.3": "He teaches a Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a renunciate life that’s entirely complete and pure. ",
  "dn10:1.8.1": "A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s son, or someone born in some good family. ",
  "dn10:1.8.2": "He gains faith in the Realized One ",
  "dn10:1.8.3": "and reflects: ",
  "dn10:1.8.4": "‘Household life is confined and dusty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. ",
  "dn10:1.8.5": "It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the renunciate life utterly complete and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "dn10:1.8.6": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "dn10:1.9.1": "After some time, he gives up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle. He shaves off hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "dn10:1.10.1": "Once he’s gone forth, he lives restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper beahvior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, he trains in the training rules. He acts skillfully by body and speech. He’s purified in livelihood and accomplished in virtue. He guards the sense doors, is endowed with recollection-and-awareness, and is content. ",
  "dn10:1.11.1": "And how is the bhikkhu accomplished in virtue? ",
  "dn10:1.11.2": "It’s when the bhikkhu gives up and abstains from killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. He’s scrupulous and kind, living compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings. ",
  "dn10:1.12.1-1.27": "This pertains to his virtue. ",
  "dn10:1.28.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still earn a living by low lore, by wrong livelihood. ",
  "dn10:1.28.2": "This includes rites for propitiation, for granting wishes, for ghosts, for the earth, for rain, for property settlement, and for preparing and consecrating house sites, and rites involving rinsing and bathing, and oblations. It also includes administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and phlegmagogues; administering ear-oils, eye restoratives, nasal medicine, ointments, and counter-ointments; surgery with needle and scalpel, treating children, prescribing root medicines, and binding on herbs. ",
  "dn10:1.28.3": "He abstains from such low arts, such wrong livelihood. ",
  "dn10:1.28.7": "This pertains to his virtue. ",
  "dn10:1.29.1": "In the same way, a bhikkhu thus accomplished in virtue sees no danger in any quarter in regards to his virtuous restraint. ",
  "dn10:1.29.2": "It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter. ",
  "dn10:1.29.3": "In the same way, a bhikkhu thus accomplished in virtue sees no danger in any quarter in regards to his virtuous restraint. ",
  "dn10:1.29.4": "Possessed of this noble aggregate of virtue, he experiences a blameless ease internally. ",
  "dn10:1.29.5": "That’s how the bhikkhu is accomplished in virtue. ",
  "dn10:1.30.1": "This is that noble aggregate of virtue that the Buddha praised. ",
  "dn10:1.30.2": "But there is still more to be done.” ",
  "dn10:1.30.3": "“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing, ",
  "dn10:1.30.4": "This noble aggregate of virtue is complete, not lacking anything! ",
  "dn10:1.30.5": "Such a complete, noble aggregate of virtue cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins. ",
  "dn10:1.30.6": "Were other ascetics and brahmins to see such a complete, noble aggregate of virtue in themselves, they’d be pleased with just that much: ",
  "dn10:1.30.7": "‘At this point it’s enough; at this point our work is done. We’ve reached the goal of our ascetic life. There is nothing more to be done.’ ",
  "dn10:1.30.8": "And yet you say: ",
  "dn10:1.30.9": "‘But there is still more to be done.’ ",
  "dn10:2.1.0": "2. The Aggregate of Composure ",
  "dn10:2.1.1": "But what, Master Ānanda, was that noble aggregate of composure that the Buddha praised?” ",
  "dn10:2.2.1": "“And how, student, does the bhikkhu guard the sense doors? ",
  "dn10:2.2.2": "When he sees a sight with the eye, he doesn’t grasp at signs and features of it ",
  "dn10:2.2.3": "on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, detrimental phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the eye faculty and brings about the restraint of the eye faculty. ",
  "dn10:2.2.4": "When he hears a sound with the ear … ",
  "dn10:2.2.5": "When he smells an odor with the nose … ",
  "dn10:2.2.6": "When he tastes a flavor with the tongue … ",
  "dn10:2.2.7": "When he touches a touch with the body … ",
  "dn10:2.2.8": "When he cognizes a phenomenon with the mental faculty, he doesn’t grasp at signs and features of it ",
  "dn10:2.2.9": "on account of which—due to abiding with the mental faculty unrestrained—bad, detrimental phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the mental faculty and brings about the restraint of the mental faculty. ",
  "dn10:2.2.10": "Possessed of this noble sense restraint, he experiences an unsullied ease internally. ",
  "dn10:2.2.11": "That’s how a bhikkhu guards the sense doors. ",
  "dn10:2.3.1": "And how is the bhikkhu possessed of recollection-and-awareness? ",
  "dn10:2.3.2": "It’s when the bhikkhu acts with awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. ",
  "dn10:2.3.3": "That’s how the bhikkhu is possessed of recollection-and-awareness. ",
  "dn10:2.4.1": "And how is the bhikkhu content? ",
  "dn10:2.4.2": "It’s when a bhikkhu is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. ",
  "dn10:2.4.3": "He’s like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. ",
  "dn10:2.4.4": "In the same way, the bhikkhu is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these things. ",
  "dn10:2.4.5": "That’s how the bhikkhu is content. ",
  "dn10:2.5.1": "Possessed of noble aggregate of noble virtue, this noble sense restraint, this noble recollection-and-awareness, and this noble contentment, ",
  "dn10:2.5.2": "he frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. ",
  "dn10:2.5.3": "After the meal, he returns from almsround, sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes recollection at the fore. ",
  "dn10:2.6.1": "Giving up longing in regard to the world, he abides with a mind rid of longing; he cleanses the mind of longing. ",
  "dn10:2.6.2": "Giving up ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind rid of ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings; he cleanses the mind of ill will and hatred. ",
  "dn10:2.6.3": "Giving up indolence-and-lethargy, he abides with a mind rid of indolence-and-lethargy, perceiving light, recollected, and aware; he cleanses the mind of indolence-and-lethargy. ",
  "dn10:2.6.4": "Giving up restlessness-and-anxiety, he abides without restlessness, his mind internally appeased; he cleanses the mind of restlessness-and-anxiety. ",
  "dn10:2.6.5": "Giving up doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, not uncertain about beneficial qualities; he cleanses the mind of doubt. ",
  "dn10:2.7.1": "Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work, ",
  "dn10:2.7.2": "and his efforts proved successful. ",
  "dn10:2.7.3": "He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partner. ",
  "dn10:2.7.4": "Thinking about this, ",
  "dn10:2.7.8": "he’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",
  "dn10:2.8.1": "Suppose a man was sick, suffering, and gravely ill. He’d lose his appetite and get physically weak. ",
  "dn10:2.8.2": "But after some time he’d recover from that illness, and regain his appetite and his strength. ",
  "dn10:2.8.3": "Thinking about this, ",
  "dn10:2.8.6": "he’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",
  "dn10:2.9.1": "Suppose a man was imprisoned in a jail. ",
  "dn10:2.9.2": "But after some time he was released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. ",
  "dn10:2.9.3": "Thinking about this, ",
  "dn10:2.9.6": "he’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",
  "dn10:2.10.1": "Suppose a man was a bondservant. He would not be his own master, but indentured to another, unable to go where he wishes. ",
  "dn10:2.10.2": "But after some time he’d be freed from servitude. He would be his own master, not indentured to another, an emancipated individual able to go where he wishes. ",
  "dn10:2.10.3": "Thinking about this, ",
  "dn10:2.10.6": "he’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",
  "dn10:2.11.1": "Suppose there was a man with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road, which was perilous, with nothing to eat. ",
  "dn10:2.11.2": "But after some time he crossed over the desert safely, arriving within a village, a sanctuary free of peril. ",
  "dn10:2.11.3": "Thinking about this, ",
  "dn10:2.11.6": "he’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",
  "dn10:2.12.1": "In the same way, the bhikkhu regards these five hindrances that are not given up in him as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing. ",
  "dn10:2.12.2": "But when these five hindrances are given up in him, the bhikkhu regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and a place of safety at last. ",
  "dn10:2.12.4": "Considering that the five hindrances have been given up in him, gladness is born. When he’s glad, joy is born. When the mind is joyous, the body becomes calm. When the body is calm, he feels at ease. When he’s at ease, the mind becomes composed. ",
  "dn10:2.13.1": "Quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from detrimental phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of separation, they abide having entered upon the first jhāna. ",
  "dn10:2.13.2": "He tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the joy and ease born of separation. There would be no part of his whole body that’s not pervaded with the joy and ease born of separation. ",
  "dn10:2.14.1": "It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. ",
  "dn10:2.14.2": "In the same way, the bhikkhu tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the joy and ease born of separation. There would be no part of his whole body that’s not pervaded with the joy and ease born of separation. ",
  "dn10:2.14.5": "This pertains to his composure. ",
  "dn10:2.15.1": "Furthermore, with the appeasement of thinking and pondering, with internal confidence and collectedness of mind, without thinking or pondering and with joy and ease born of composure, a bhikkhu abides having entered upon the second jhāna. ",
  "dn10:2.15.2": "He tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the joy and ease born of composure. There would be no part of his whole body that’s not pervaded with the joy and ease born of composure. ",
  "dn10:2.16.1": "It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water where there would be no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake would top up, suffuse, fill, and pervade the lake. There would be no part of the whole lake that’s not pervaded with cool water. ",
  "dn10:2.16.2": "In the same way, the bhikkhu tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the joy and ease born of composure. There would be no part of his whole body that’s not pervaded with the joy and ease born of composure. ",
  "dn10:2.16.5": "This pertains to his composure. ",
  "dn10:2.17.1": "Furthermore, with the fading of joy, the bhikkhu abides equanimous, recollected, and aware, experiencing ease with the body. He abides having entered upon the third jhāna, with regard to which the noble ones say “one abides equanimous, recollected, and at ease.” ",
  "dn10:2.17.2": "He tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his body with the ease devoid of joy. There would be no part of his whole body that’s not pervaded with the ease devoid of joy. ",
  "dn10:2.17.3": "It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re topped up, suffused, filled, and pervaded with cool water. There would be no part of them that’s not pervaded with cool water. ",
  "dn10:2.17.4": "In the same way, the bhikkhu tops up, suffuses, fills, and pervades his whole body with the ease devoid of joy. There would be no part of his whole body that’s not pervaded with the ease devoid of joy. ",
  "dn10:2.17.7": "This pertains to his composure. ",
  "dn10:2.18.1": "Furthermore, with the giving up of ease and unease—and with the ending of joys and upsets beforehand—without ease or unease, with purity of equanimity and recollection, a bhikkhu abides having entered upon the fourth jhāna. ",
  "dn10:2.18.2": "He sits having pervaded his body with a pure, bright mind. ",
