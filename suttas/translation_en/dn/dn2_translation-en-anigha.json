  "dn2:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "dn2:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 bhikkhus. ",
  "dn2:1.3": "Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministers. ",
  "dn2:1.4": "Then Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, expressed this heartfelt sentiment, ",
  "dn2:1.5": "“Oh, sirs, this moonlit night is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so pleasant, so striking. ",
  "dn2:1.6": "Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?” ",
  "dn2:2.1": "When he had spoken, one of the king’s ministers said to him, ",
  "dn2:2.2": "“Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. ",
  "dn2:2.3": "Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. ",
  "dn2:2.4": "Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” ",
  "dn2:2.5": "But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. ",
  "dn2:3.1": "Another of the king’s ministers said to him, ",
  "dn2:3.2": "“Sire, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. ",

  "dn2:4.3": "Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. ",

  "dn2:7.5": "But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. ",
  "dn2:8.0": "2. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca ",
  "dn2:8.1": "Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king. ",
  "dn2:8.2": "Then the king said to him, ",
  "dn2:8.3": "“But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?” ",
  "dn2:8.4": "“Sire, the Blessed One, the Arahant, the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 bhikkhus. ",
  "dn2:8.5": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "dn2:8.6": "‘That Blessed One is an Arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "dn2:8.7": "Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. ",
  "dn2:8.8": "Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” ",
  "dn2:8.9": "“Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied.” ",
  "dn2:9.1": "“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka. He had around five hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king’s bull elephant for riding. Then he informed the king, ",
  "dn2:9.2": "“The elephants are ready, sire. ",
  "dn2:9.3": "Please go at your convenience.” ",
  "dn2:10.1": "Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvaka’s mango grove. ",
  "dn2:10.2": "But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end. ",
  "dn2:10.3": "He said to Jīvaka, ",
  "dn2:10.4": "“My dear Jīvaka, I hope you’re not deceiving me! ",
  "dn2:10.5": "I hope you’re not betraying me! ",
  "dn2:10.6": "I hope you’re not turning me over to my enemies! ",
  "dn2:10.7": "For how on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of 1,250 bhikkhus?” ",
  "dn2:10.8": "“Do not fear, great king, do not fear! ",
  "dn2:10.9": "I am not deceiving you, ",
  "dn2:10.10": "or betraying you, ",
  "dn2:10.11": "or turning you over to your enemies. ",
  "dn2:10.12": "Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps shining in the pavilion.” ",
  "dn2:11.0": "3. The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life ",
  "dn2:11.1": "Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot, where he asked Jīvaka, ",
  "dn2:11.2": "“But my dear Jīvaka, where is the Buddha?” ",
  "dn2:11.3": "“That is the Buddha, great king, that is the Buddha! ",
  "dn2:11.4": "He’s sitting against the central column facing east, in front of the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.” ",
  "dn2:12.1": "Then the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one side. ",
  "dn2:12.2": "He looked around the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, who were so very silent, like a still, clear lake, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment, ",
  "dn2:12.3": "“May my son, Prince Udāyibhadda, be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of bhikkhus now enjoys!” ",
  "dn2:12.4": "“Has your mind gone to one you love, great king?” ",
  "dn2:12.5": "“Bhante, I love my son, Prince Udāyibhadda. ",
  "dn2:12.6": "May he be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of bhikkhus now enjoys!” ",
  "dn2:13.1": "Then the king bowed to the Buddha, raised his joined palms toward the Saṅgha, and sat down to one side. ",
  "dn2:13.2": "He said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn2:13.3": "“Sir, I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” ",
  "dn2:13.4": "",
  "dn2:13.5": "“Ask what you wish, great king.” ",
  "dn2:14.1": "“Sir, there are many different professional fields. ",
  "dn2:14.2": "These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. ",
  "dn2:14.3": "They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are presently evident. ",
  "dn2:14.4": "With that they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. ",
  "dn2:14.5": "Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise presently evident?” ",
  "dn2:15.1": "“Great king, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?” ",
  "dn2:15.2": "“I do, sir.” ",
  "dn2:15.3": "“If you wouldn’t mind, great king, tell me how they answered.” ",
  "dn2:15.4": "“It’s no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here.” ",
  "dn2:15.5": "“Well, speak then, great king.” ",
  "dn2:16.0": "3.1. The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa ",
  "dn2:16.1": "“One time, Bhante, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
  "dn2:16.2": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. ",
  "dn2:16.3": "",
  "dn2:16.4": "",
  "dn2:16.5": "",
  "dn2:16.6": "",
  "dn2:17.1": "He said to me: ",
  "dn2:17.2": "‘Great king, the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. ",
  "dn2:17.3": "If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. ",
  "dn2:17.4": "If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit. ",
  "dn2:17.5": "In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’ ",
  "dn2:18.1": "And so, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the doctrine of inaction. ",
  "dn2:18.2": "It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. ",
  "dn2:18.3": "",
  "dn2:18.4": "I thought: ",
  "dn2:18.5": "‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ ",
  "dn2:18.6": "So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa. ",
  "dn2:18.7": "I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. ",
  "dn2:19.0": "3.2. The Doctrine of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla ",
  "dn2:19.1": "One time, Bhante, I approached the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
  "dn2:19.2": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. ",
  "dn2:19.3": "",
  "dn2:19.4": "",
  "dn2:20.1": "He said: ",
  "dn2:20.2": "‘Great king, there is no cause or reason for the defilement of beings. Beings are corrupted without cause or reason. ",
  "dn2:20.3": "There’s no cause or reason for the purification of beings. ",
  "dn2:20.4": "Beings are purified without cause or reason. ",
  "dn2:20.5": "One does not act of one’s own volition, one does not act of another’s volition, one does not act from a person’s volition. There is no power, no effort, no human strength or vigor. ",
  "dn2:20.6": "All beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth. ",
  "dn2:20.7": "There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of birth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven knotless embryos. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven rivers, 700 rivers, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. ",
  "dn2:20.8": "And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or renunciate life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little,” for that cannot be. ",
  "dn2:20.9": "Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. ",
  "dn2:20.10": "It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. ",
  "dn2:20.11": "In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’ ",
  "dn2:21.1": "And so, when I asked the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration. ",
  "dn2:21.2": "It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. ",
  "dn2:21.3": "",
  "dn2:21.4": "I thought: ",
  "dn2:21.5": "‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ ",

  "dn2:21.7": "I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. ",
  "dn2:22.0": "3.3. The Doctrine of Ajita of the Hair Blanket ",
  "dn2:22.1": "One time, Bhante, I approached Ajita of the hair blanket and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
  "dn2:22.2": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. ",
  "dn2:22.3": "",
  "dn2:22.4": "",
  "dn2:23.1": "He said: ",
  "dn2:23.2": "‘There’s no giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad actions. This world doesn’t exist, nor the other world. There is no mother or father, nor beings that reappear spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who, having comprehended and experienced it for himself, makes known this world and the other. ",
  "dn2:23.3": "This person is made up of the four great elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space. ",
  "dn2:23.4": "Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. ",
  "dn2:23.5": "Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. ",
  "dn2:23.6": "The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. ",
  "dn2:23.7": "Giving is a doctrine of idiots. ",
  "dn2:23.8": "When anyone affirms a teaching of action and afterlife, it’s just hollow, false nonsense. ",
  "dn2:23.9": "Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don’t exist after death.’ ",
  "dn2:24.1": "And so, when I asked Ajita of the hair blanket about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the doctrine of annihilationism. ",
  "dn2:24.2": "It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. ",
  "dn2:24.3": "",
  "dn2:24.4": "I thought: ",

  "dn2:25.0": "3.4. The Doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana ",
  "dn2:25.1": "One time, Bhante, I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana and exchanged pleasantries with him. ",
  "dn2:25.2": "When the amicable and cordial talk was over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. ",
  "dn2:25.3": "",
  "dn2:25.4": "",
  "dn2:26.1": "He said: ",
  "dn2:26.2": "‘Great king, these seven masses are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. ",
  "dn2:26.3": "They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. ",
  "dn2:26.4": "What seven? ",
  "dn2:26.5": "The masses of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. ",
  "dn2:26.6": "These seven masses are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. ",
  "dn2:26.7": "They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. ",
  "dn2:26.8": "And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand. ",
  "dn2:26.9": "If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. ",
  "dn2:26.10": "The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven masses.’ ",
  "dn2:27.1": "And so, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with something else entirely. ",
  "dn2:27.2": "It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. ",
  "dn2:27.3": "",

  "dn2:28.4": "",
  "dn2:29.1": "He said: ",
  "dn2:29.2": "‘Great king, consider a Jain who is restrained in the fourfold constraint. ",
  "dn2:29.3": "And how is a Jain restrained in the fourfold constraint? ",
  "dn2:29.4": "It’s when a Jain is restrained in all that is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has shaken off all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all that is to be restrained. ",
  "dn2:29.5": "That’s how a Jain is restrained in the fourfold constraint. ",
  "dn2:29.6": "When a Jain is restrained in the fourfold constraint, ",
  "dn2:29.7": "they’re called a knotless one who is self-realized, self-controlled, and steadfast.’ ",
  "dn2:30.1": "And so, when I asked the Jain Ñātika about the fruits of the ascetic life that are presently evident, he answered with the fourfold constraint. ",
