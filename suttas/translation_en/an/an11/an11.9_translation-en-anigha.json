  "an11.9:2.1": "“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred, ",
  "an11.9:2.2": "not like a wild colt. ",
  "an11.9:2.3": "And how does a wild colt meditate? ",
  "an11.9:2.4": "A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ ",
  "an11.9:2.5": "Why is that? ",
  "an11.9:2.6": "Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough: ",

  "an11.9:2.8": "Tied up by the feeding trough it just meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ ",
  "an11.9:2.9": "In the same way, take a certain untrained person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their mind is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t understand as it is the escape from arisen sensual desire. ",

  "an11.9:3.1": "And how does a thoroughbred meditate? ",
  "an11.9:3.2": "A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ ",

The perception of the extent of infinite space is absent while the extent of infinite space is there. The perception of the extent of infinite consciousness … nothingness … neither-perception-nor-non-perception is absent while the extent of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is there. The perception of this world has while this world is there. The perception of the other world is absent while the other world is there.
