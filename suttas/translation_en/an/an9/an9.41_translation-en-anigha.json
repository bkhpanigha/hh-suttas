  "an9.41:1.2": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Uruvelakappa for alms. ",
  "an9.41:1.3": "Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, ",
  "an9.41:1.4": "“Ānanda, you stay right here, while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day’s abiding.” ",
  "an9.41:1.5": "“Yes, Bhante,” Ānanda replied. ",

  "an9.41:2.1": "The householder Tapussa went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: ",
  "an9.41:3.1": "“Bhante Ānanda, we are laypeople who partake in sensuality. We enjoy sensuality, we are fond of it and are pleased by it. ",
  "an9.41:3.2": "To us laypeople who partake in sensuality, who enjoy it, are fond of it, and are pleased by it, renunciation seems like an abyss. ",
  "an9.41:3.3": "I have heard that in this teaching-and-discipline there are very young bhikkhus whose minds leap at renunciation; their minds, seeing it as peaceful, are confident, settled, and liberated in it. ",
  "an9.41:3.4": "It is precisely renunciation that is the dividing line between the multitude and the bhikkhus in this teaching-and-discipline.” ",
  "an9.41:4.1": "“Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter. ",
