    "mn13:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
    "mn13:2.1": "Then several bhikkhus robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. ",
    "mn13:2.2": "Then it occurred to them, ",
    "mn13:2.3": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. ",
    "mn13:2.4": "Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other sects?” ",
    "mn13:2.5": "Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other sects and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. ",
    "mn13:2.6": "When the amicable and pleasing talk was over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: ",
    "mn13:3.1": "“Friends, the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensuality, and so do we. ",
    "mn13:3.2": "The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of forms, and so do we. ",
    "mn13:3.3": "The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings, and so do we. ",
    "mn13:3.4": "What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” ",
    "mn13:3.5": " ",
    "mn13:4.1": "Those bhikkhus neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other sects. ",
    "mn13:4.2": "They got up from their seat, thinking, ",
    "mn13:4.3": "“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” ",
    "mn13:5.1": "Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: ",

    "mn13:6.1": "“Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other sects say this, you should say to them: ",
    "mn13:6.2": "‘But friends, what’s the charm, the danger, and the escape when it comes to sensuality? ",

    "mn13:6.4": "What’s the charm, the danger, and the escape when it comes to feelings?’ ",
    "mn13:6.5": "Questioned like this, the wanderers of other sects would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. ",
    "mn13:6.6": "Why is that? ",
    "mn13:6.7": "Because they’re out of their element. ",
    "mn13:6.8": "I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. ",
    "mn13:7.1": "And what is the charm of sensuality? ",
    "mn13:7.2": "There are these five strands of sensuality. ",

    "mn13:8.4": "But they must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst. ",
    "mn13:8.5": "This is a danger of sensuality apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
    "mn13:9.1": "That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to earn any money. ",
    "mn13:9.2": "If this happens, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion, saying: ",

    "mn13:10.1": "That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, and succeed in earning money. ",
    "mn13:10.2": "But they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it, thinking: ",
    "mn13:10.3": "‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ ",
    "mn13:10.4": "And even though they protect it and ward it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. ",

    "mn13:10.6": "‘What once was mine is gone.’ ",
    "mn13:10.7": "This too is a danger of sensuality apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
    "mn13:11.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend. ",
    "mn13:11.2": "Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords, ",

    "mn13:13.4": "This too is a danger of sensuality apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensuality. ",
    "mn13:14.1": "Furthermore, for the sake of sensuality they break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery. ",
    "mn13:14.2": "The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments— ",
    "mn13:14.3": "whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.

    "mn13:16.2": "Removing and giving up desire and passion for sensuality: this is the escape from sensuality. ",
    "mn13:17.1": "That any ascetics or brahmins who don’t understand as they are the charm, danger, and escape from sensuality in this way will themselves completely understand sensuality, or instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand sensuality—that is impossible.

    "mn13:18.2": "Suppose there was a girl of the brahmins, aristocrats, or householders in her fifteenth or sixteenth year, neither too tall nor too short, neither too thin nor too fat, neither too dark nor too fair. Is she not at the height of her beauty and prettiness?” ",
